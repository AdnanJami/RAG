In the beginning of this chapter we will present this concept. The most important topic in science is energy. From our experience we see that the world becomes inactive without energy. We get energy in different forms. Such as kinetic energy for motion, potential energy for object in higher position from the ground, the energy of spring at contract condition or expanding condition, heat energy of hot body, electrical energy of charged body etc. The energy is transforming from one form to another gradually although the total energy of the universe remains unchanged and constant. In this chapter we will discuss about the transformation of energy and the law of conservation of energy, one of the important laws of science.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to - 1. Explain the relation between work and energy. 2. Establish the relation among work, force and displacement. \u20183: 3. Explain kinetic and potential energy. 4.

Establish the relation between transmission of energy and power. 12. Measure the efficiency. Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy. 4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power = Work Time If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be, P = t (4.4) Power has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. Dimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of . Work Time Power = Work Time = Force x Displacement Time = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement Time = Mass x Displacement x Displacement Time x Time2 = Mass x Displacement2 Time3 \u2234 [P] = ML2 T3 = [ML2T-3]"

        "answer": "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, while potential energy is the energy of position.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion, while potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position or configuration. For example, a moving car has kinetic energy, and a book held above the ground has potential energy.",
        "referenceContext": "The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object.",
        "context": "Physics case, the work done is the product of the applied gravitational force i.e. the weight of the body and the vertical height. \u2234 Potential energy = weight of the body \u00d7 vertical height = mgh o E,=mgh (4.3) i.e. potential energy = mass of the body \u00d7 acceleration due to gravity \u00d7 vertical height Potential energy depends on the vertical height of the object from the surface of the earth. The more is the height, the higher will be the potential energy. Potential energy also depends on the mass of the object. The more the mass the more will be the potential energy of the object. To use the potential energy stored in a body it is necessary to transform it into other form of energy. For example, a piece of stone is not dangerous as long as it is on the roof and its potential energy transforms into kinetic energy i.e. it starts to fall. Mathematical Example 4.3: What will be the potential energy of a body of mass 6kg if it is raised to a height of 20m above the surface of the earth? g = 9.8 ms-2. We know, Ep = mgh = 6kg \u00d7 9.8 ms-2 \u00d7 20m = 1176 J Here, Mass of the body, m = 6 kg Height, h = 20m g = 9.8 ms-2 Potential Energy, Ep = ? Ans: 1176 J 4.3 Prime Sources of Energy The modern mechanized civilization cannot proceed a moment without energy. Work is available at the expense of energy. Uninterrupted energy supply is essential for the survival of all living creatures. The demand of energy is increasing day by day with the development of life style. For this increasing demand of energy man is looking for newer sources of energy. We need to have clear idea about the sources of energy to save the living beings and to continue the supply of energy. We know that the sun is the only source of all energy. Moreover, the nuclear energy in the nucleus and the energy from the hot melted substances are considered to be the sources of energy. All the existing energy of the world is directly or indirectly comes from the sun or are produced using the radiation of the sun. Chemical Energy/Fuel Energy: Man in the ancient time was dependent wholly on the energy of their muscles. Afterwards, they learnt to tame the wild animals and use their energy in different work. They used to carry their goods and cultivate land with the help of animals. The initial stage of civilization was to produce heat energy from burning wood and leaves and mechanical energy from current of water and flow of wind. The economic development of human being begins from the use of machine energy. Industrial revolution and invention of steam engine reduced men\u2019s dependence on muscle energy of human and animals. Man kept operating different machines with the help of steam energy. Fuel is Physics 5. What is the maximum kinetic energy? a) 1.25 x 105 J c) 1.25 x 104 J b) 5 x 104 J d) 6.2 x 103 J 6.

The stick is dragged 5cm. a) What is the energy used in rubbing? b) What is the power needed if it takes 0.5s to drag the stick? 2. The reservoir of a hydro-electric project is 800m high from the sea level and the power station is 250m high. The water of reservoir rotates a turbine coming through the pipe. There is 20 x 108 liter water in the reservoir. If the mass of 1 liter water is 1kg find the potential energy stored in the water of the reservoir. 3.

It is more advantageous to produce nuclear energy than the power station that uses fuel because no green house gas is produced. a) What are the other advantages of using nuclear energy? b) What are the disadvantages of using nuclear energy? Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy.

        "question": "What are some examples of renewable energy sources?",

        "referenceAnswer": "Renewable energy sources are those that can be replenished naturally, such as solar energy, hydroelectricity, wind energy, geothermal energy, and biomass energy.",
        "referenceContext": "So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy from water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc are the main sources. These sources are directly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As long as earth receives sunlight the energy supply from these sources is possible. These are called renewable sources.",
        "context": "Physics petroleum well. The principal element in a natural gas is the methane gas. These are called fossil energy. The three sources of energy discussed above are reducing very fast due to the men\u2019s increasing demand of energy. The physical condition of the world is such that these sources-coal, mineral oil, natural gas cannot be recreated, these are called nonrenewable energy. So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy from water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc are the main sources. These sources are directly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As long as earth receives sunlight the energy supply from these sources is possible. These are called renewable sources. Solar Energy: The energy that we obtain from the sun is called Solar Energy. It is known to all that the sun is the source of all energy. The origin of all forms of energy is from the solar energy in one way or the other. For an example, the fossil fuel such as coal, mineral, oil, and natural gas is actually a store of solar energy for a long time. From ancient times man is using sunlight directly to dry things. At present man is adopting various means to use the solar energy round the clock. Ignition can be done by concentrating sun\u2019s rays- with the help of a convex lens. Solar cooker consists of a metallic bowl on which the solar rays are reflected. The cooker can be used in cooking purposes. Do it yourself: Take a concave mirror with a focal length of 15cm or 20cm. Hold the mirror facing the sun. Take a piece of paper and concentrate the sunlight with the help of the mirror on it. Hold the mirror till the paper ignites. The solar rays are used to keep the dwelling houses warm in cold countries. Solar energy is used for drying purposes of crops, fish, vegetables etc. Dried fish can be preserved for many days. More examples of solar energy are- solar water heater, solar cooker etc. Solar cell has been made by using modern technology. The characteristics of a solar cell are that the cell produces electricity instantly while solar rays fall upon it. There are various uses of solar cell. 1. This cell is used to supply electricity in artificial satellites. For this reason the artificial satellites move along their orbits for a long time. 2. Solar energy is being used to operate different electronic devices like pocket calculator, pocket radio and electronic watch. 3. Currently electrical energy is produced from solar energy in the rural area, houses or offices to meet up the need of electricity. The advantage of solar energy is that it does not pollute the environment. There is almost no possibility of danger in using this energy. There is also no possibility of sudden exhaustion of solar energy. This is why it is likely to be used as a prospective fuel instead of fossil fuel. Hydroelectricity (Transformation of mechanical energy): Water is one of the renewable sources of energy. Energy can be produced by means of water current and tide and ebb. There are different forms of energy in the water current Physics in Soviet Union (at present Ukraine) and Fukushima in Japan. In nuclear power production less greenhouse gas is released in the environment. The Social Effects and Advantages of Renewable Energy Uses of renewable energy have a far-reaching effect on our social life. In comparison with the demand of our country the storage of coal, petroleum and natural gas is very poor. So, we have to import mineral oil and coal from abroad to meet up the demand of energy by spending a lot of valuable foreign currency. But utilizing the renewable energy sources that we have in our country especially if we can encourage the people to produce and use biogas, we will be able to change the infrastructure of rural area. We can focus our attention to electricity production using windmill. If we can make the use of solar energy available through research, we will be able to meet up all our demands of energy from this unlimited source. The main advantage of using of renewable energy is that there is no possibility of diminishing of energy. Moreover it will be possible to protect our country from environment pollution. 4.4 Transformation of energy Energy is being transformed continuously from one form to another. Various incidents are taking place in this universe due to transformation of energy. Though energy is transforming from one form to more than one form, the total amount of energy in this universe remains unchanged. Transformation of energy is required for man, computer or any other machine to work or to make any change or to process anything. One form of energy can be used to produce another different form of energy. Actually, one form of energy is simultaneously transforming into another form which is known as the transformation of energy. What happens when anyone plays guitar? The muscle energy of the artist transforms into mechanical energy on the vibrating string which transforms into sound energy as a melodious music and travels to our ears. When wood is burned chemical energy is released and transforms into heat and light energy. A chemical reaction takes place in an electric cell and the chemical energy of these reactions transforms into electric energy which is used for various purposes. When a definite amount of energy of a particular form is transformed how much energy is obtained? It can be known from the law of conservation of energy. When such a transformation takes place there is no net loss of energy. The energy lost by one body is exactly equal to the energy gained by another body. In fact, we can neither create energy nor destroy it. In other words the total energy of the universe does neither increase nor decrease. The amount of energy that existed in the universe at the moment of its creation exists till today. This known as conservation of energy. Principle of Conservation of Energy: Energy can be transformed form one form to another or more forms. The total energy of the universe is constant and unchangeable. Physics necessary to produce this steam energy. So we consider different kinds of fuels to be the sources of energy. The most common sources of energy are coal, mineral oil and natural gas. Coal, mineral oil and natural gas from underground are used as fuel directly or by refining them slightly. Coal: Coal is best known to us as one of the sources of energy. It is an organic substance. Once upon a time there were numerous plants and trees. Due to different natural calamities and natural consequences the leaves of the trees and their stems were buried underneath the earth and began to coagulate. As a result of chemical changes, the leaves of the trees and stems were transformed into coal. Combustion of coal gives us heat directly. This is a well known fuel. Many essential substances can be produced from coal apart from using it as a fuel. Some of the coal products are coal gas, tar, benzene, ammonia, toluene etc. Coal is used to cook food and to drive the steam engines. In modern age, the main use of coal is in thermal power plants. The main fuel in a thermal power station is coal. The main problem of a coal fueled power station is that it emits sulphur smog which causes acid rain. Though this acid is very weak, it kills the fishes of pond, cannel and lake, destroys forest and damages the sculptures of stone. Mineral Oil: Petroleum or mineral oil is one of the principal sources of energy. It is widely used as a fuel in the present world. It is being used right from a rural cottage to the most modern transport system. Petrol, pitch that is used to pave roads, kerosene and chemical fertilizers are all petroleum products. There is nothing like petrol to be used as fuel. On the other hand, many kinds of artificial fabrics can be developed from petroleum. These are terry line, polyester, cashmilon etc. Moreover, various types of cosmetics are produced from petroleum. But it is basically used as a fuel. Petroleum products are used to produce electric and mechanical energy. Petroleum is a Latin word. It is a combination of two minor words: Petro and Olium. In Latin language \u2018petro\u2019 means stone and \u2018olium\u2019 means oil. So, petroleum means oil of stones i.e. oil stored inside stones. In tertiary age i.e. almost five to six crores of years ago the trees and the animals fell buried in the different layers of sedimentary rock on the bottom of the sea. Due to different chemical changes these were transformed into mineral oil. Most of the solid regions of the present world were a part of the bottom region of the sea in prehistoric age. Natural Gas: Natural gas is a well known source of energy. Specially, the use of natural gas in Bangladesh is wider. Use of natural gas is very high in all advanced countries. It is also used in different industries as fuel. In Bangladesh it is widely used for domestic requirement basically for cooking purposes. It is also used in fertilizer factories. Heat energy is produced by the combustion of gas and electric energy is produced from heat energy in a thermal power station. Natural gas is obtained from underneath the earth. Digging very deep well the gas may be taken out from underneath the earth. Tremendous temperature and pressure inside the earth is the root cause of the creation of the gas. Natural gas is also available in 75"

Establish the relation between transmission of energy and power. 12. Measure the efficiency. Physics 4.6 Efficiency: We fulfill our daily needs with the help of transformation of energy. For example we run an engine by transforming chemical energy stored in petrol into kinetic energy. According to the principle of conservation of energy, we should obtain the amount of energy which is given to the engine. But it is seen that the energy gained is always less than the energy given to. This is because some energy is lost due to the work done against the frictional force of the engine. The amount of energy obtained from the engine is called effective energy. In this case the equation of energy is, Given energy = Effective energy + the energy lost in other ways The efficiency of an engine means that how much of the given energy is obtained as effective energy. So, the efficiency means the ratio of effective energy and the total given energy. Usually the efficiency is expressed in percentage. \u2234 efficiency, \u03b7 = Effective energy Total input energy \u00d7 100% Energy transformation takes place in different steps in a normal electricity production centre. This transformation continues from coal, oil, natural gas or Uranium up to the production of electricity. It is seen that up to 70% of this energy is lost as heat energy. At last only the 30% of input energy is transformed into useable electrical energy. So, we can say the efficiency of the electricity production centre is 30%. Mathematical Example 4.5: An electric motor is used to lift a body of weight 10N at a height 5m. It uses electrical energy of 65J. a) What is the energy lost by the motor? b) Find the efficiency of the motor. Ans: a) Here, energy used = work done = Force x displacement = Weight x height = 10N x 5m = 50J \u2234 The energy lost = Energy supplied \u2013 energy used = 65J \u2013 50J = 15J b) Efficiency, \u03b7 = Effective energy x 100% Total input energy = 50J x 100% 65J = 76.92% Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses.

The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced.

Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.

        "answer": "Power is the rate of doing work, which is the product of work and time. Mathematically, it can be represented as: Power (P) = Work (W) / Time (t) = W/t.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transformed. It is measured as the amount of work done per unit time.",
        "referenceContext": "Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.",
        "context": "Physics Unit: We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-Since watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier. Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., . Total Time Perform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them. Who is the most powerful student in your class?

Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy.

        "answer": "This is not part of your current syllabus",
        "referenceAnswer": "In everyday language, 'work' refers to any activity. However, in physics, work has a specific definition. Work is done when a force acts on an object and causes it to displace. It requires both force and displacement for work to be done.",

The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc. Let us consider the following examples: a) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand. b) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. c) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. d) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force \u00d7 Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, F s NN NN W= Fs\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (4.1) Work has no direction.

Since the unit of force is Newton (N) and the unit of distance is meter (m) then the unit of work will be newton-meter (Nm) which is called joule. Joule is expressed by J. If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity. Mathematical example 4.1: A man of mass 70kg climbs on a mountain of height 200m. How much work will he do? Given, Mass of man, m = 70kg Force, F = weight of the man = mg = 70kg \u00d7 9.8 ms-2 = 686N Displacement, S = 200m Work, W =? We know, W = Fs = 686N \u00d7 200m = 1.372 \u00d7 105 J Ans: 1.372 \u00d7 105 J 4.2 Energy Nothing can move or work without energy. We need energy for our survival. The amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work. So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work."

This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced.

        "question": "What is the law of conservation of energy, and how does it relate to the transformation of energy?",
        "answer": "The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. In other words, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This law applies to all forms of energy, including mechanical, thermal, electrical, and nuclear energy. The transformation of energy is a fundamental concept in physics, where energy is converted from one form to another, but the total energy remains the same. This law is a fundamental principle in physics and is widely applicable to various fields, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism.",
        "referenceAnswer": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant. While energy can change forms (like chemical energy turning into heat energy), the total amount of energy before and after the transformation stays the same.",

All of them are related to one another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy transformation are described below. 1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy. 2. Transformation of heat Energy: In steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. 3. Transformation of light energy: If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is transformed into chemical energy. 4. Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 5. Transformation of electrical energy: In electric motor electric energy is transformed into mechanical energy. In instruments like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy: In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy. Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy. 4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power.

Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-Since watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier. Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., . Total Time Perform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them. Who is the most powerful student in your class?

Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done. The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc. Let us consider the following examples: a) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand. b) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. c) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. d) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force \u00d7 Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, F s NN NN W= Fs\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (4.1) Work has no direction. It is a scalar quantity. Dimension of Work: Figure: 4.Dimension of work will be the dimension of force \u00d7 dimension of displacement Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored Physics or, Work = Force \u00d7 displacement = mass \u00d7 acceleration \u00d7 displacement = mass \u00d7 displacement \u00d7 displacement ( time )2 = mass \u00d7 (displacement)2 ( time )or, W = ML2 T2 \u2234 [W] = [ML2T-2] Unit of work: The unit of work is obtained by multiplying the unit of force with unit of distance. Since the unit of force is Newton (N) and the unit of distance is meter (m) then the unit of work will be newton-meter (Nm) which is called joule. Joule is expressed by J. If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity. Mathematical example 4.1: A man of mass 70kg climbs on a mountain of height 200m. How much work will he do? Given, Mass of man, m = 70kg Force, F = weight of the man = mg = 70kg \u00d7 9.8 ms-2 = 686N Displacement, S = 200m Work, W =? We know, W = Fs = 686N \u00d7 200m = 1.372 \u00d7 105 J Ans: 1.372 \u00d7 105 J 4.2 Energy Nothing can move or work without energy. We need energy for our survival. The amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work. So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work."

Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 5. Transformation of electrical energy: In electric motor electric energy is transformed into mechanical energy. In instruments like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy: In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy. Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored"

        "question": "What is the law of conservation of energy, and how does it apply to the transformation of energy?",
        "answer": "The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. In other words, energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This law applies to the transformation of energy as it states that the total energy before a transformation is equal to the total energy after the transformation. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n\nEnergy before transformation = Energy after transformation\n\nThis law is applicable to all forms of energy, including mechanical, thermal, electrical, and nuclear energy. The transformation of energy from one form to another does not change the total energy of the system, but rather changes the form in which it is expressed.",
        "referenceAnswer": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. This means that the total amount of energy in the universe remains constant. For example, when you burn wood, the chemical energy stored in the wood is transformed into heat and light energy, but the total amount of energy remains the same.",
        "referenceContext": "In fact, we can neither create energy nor destroy it. In other words the total energy of the universe does neither increase nor decrease.

In the beginning of this chapter we will present this concept. The most important topic in science is energy. From our experience we see that the world becomes inactive without energy. We get energy in different forms. Such as kinetic energy for motion, potential energy for object in higher position from the ground, the energy of spring at contract condition or expanding condition, heat energy of hot body, electrical energy of charged body etc. The energy is transforming from one form to another gradually although the total energy of the universe remains unchanged and constant. In this chapter we will discuss about the transformation of energy and the law of conservation of energy, one of the important laws of science.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to - 1. Explain the relation between work and energy. 2. Establish the relation among work, force and displacement. \u20183: 3. Explain kinetic and potential energy. 4.

Establish the relation between transmission of energy and power. 12. Measure the efficiency. Physics Transformation of energy: We have mentioned earlier about different forms of energy. All of them are related to one another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy transformation are described below. 1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy. 2. Transformation of heat Energy: In steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. 3. Transformation of light energy: If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is transformed into chemical energy. 4. Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 5. Transformation of electrical energy: In electric motor electric energy is transformed into mechanical energy. In instruments like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy: In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy. Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy. 4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power = Work Time If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be, P = t (4.4) Power has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. Dimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of . Work Time Power = Work Time = Force x Displacement Time = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement Time = Mass x Displacement x Displacement Time x Time2 = Mass x Displacement2 Time3 \u2234 [P] = ML2 T3 = [ML2T-3]"

        "answer": "Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It is measured in units of Joule per second (J/s) or Watt (W).",
        "referenceAnswer": "Power in physics is the rate at which work is done or energy is transformed. It tells us how quickly energy is being used or transferred. The standard unit for power is the Watt (W), where 1 Watt equals 1 Joule per second (1 J/s).  Another unit is horsepower (hp), which is equivalent to 746 watts.",
        "referenceContext": "Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.",
        "context": "Physics Unit: We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-Since watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier. Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., . Total Time Perform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them. Who is the most powerful student in your class? Physics So, the physical quantities which are independent or neutral that is, they do not depend on other quantity, rather other quantities depend on them, are called fundamental quantities. Scientists have identified seven such quantities as fundamental quantities which are used in all branches of science for measurement. These are (1) length (2) mass (3) time (4) temperature (5) electric current (6) luminous intensity and (7) amount of substance. All other quantities may be derived from fundamental quantities that means, these are obtained from the product or quotient of one or more fundamental quantities. These are called derived quantities or compound quantities. So, the quantities depend on fundamental quantities or obtain from fundamental quantities are called derived quantities. Velocity, acceleration, force, work, heat, electric current etc. are derived quantities since these are obtain from fundamental quantities. For instance, force = mass x acceleration = mass \u00d7 velocity time [ acceleration = velocity time ] = mass \u00d7 distance time \u00d7 1 time [ velocity = distance time ] distance = mass \u00d7 time2 Hence, force is a derived quantity. 1.5 Units of measurements Measurement is related to most of our daily activities. Moreover, we need accurate measurement for various research works. The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu\u2019s home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school\u2019s office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter\u2019s unit. There are different Physics units for measurement of time, volume, velocity, mass, force, energy, temperature, electric current etc. These units have been designed in such way that they can be convenient and can be easily and accurately reproduced. Except some units all these units are interrelated with one another. Fundamental unit in SI We can select fundamental units according to your liking, since the units of fundamental quantities do not depend on other units. But our selection must have international recognition. It should have some characteristics as well. For example, it should be unchangeable, that is, independent of place, time and person. It will not change due to passage of time or any other natural change. It could be reproduced easily. The standard of fundamental units that were accepted in 1960, while introducing the SI system of units, were changed later on in some cases in order to attain suitable characteristics. But no change was brought in values of the units. For example, at present, meter is defined in terms of distance traveled by light. Earlier, meter was defined using wavelength of a kind of light. Prior to it, the length of a rod kept at Sevres near Paris in France was taken as the standard of meter. The latest accepted standard of fundamental units in International System are described below Unit of length : Meter : The distance traveled by light in vacuum (air-free space) in second is defined as one meter (m). Unit of mass : Kilogram : The kilogram is the mass equal to that of a cylinder made of platinum-iridium alloy (International prototype kilogram) kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures at Severs, France. The diameter of this cylinder is 3.9 cm ; its height is also 3.9 cm. Unit of time : Second :The time required to complete 9 192 631 770 vibrations by a caesium-133 atom is called one second (s). Unit of temperature : Kelvin : The temperature which equals to 273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water is called one Kelvin (k). Unit of electric current : Ampere : The ampere is that current which produces a force of 2x10-7 Newton per meter in vacuum between two parallel infinitely long conductors of negligible cross-sectional area 1 meter apart when each conductor carries the same current. Unit of luminous intensity: Candela : Candela is the quantity of luminous intensity of any source of light which radiates monochromatic radiation at a particular direction with a frequency of 540x1012 Hz and emissive power of 1 683 watt per steredian solid angle."

This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor.",
        "context": "Physics in Soviet Union (at present Ukraine) and Fukushima in Japan. In nuclear power production less greenhouse gas is released in the environment. The Social Effects and Advantages of Renewable Energy Uses of renewable energy have a far-reaching effect on our social life. In comparison with the demand of our country the storage of coal, petroleum and natural gas is very poor. So, we have to import mineral oil and coal from abroad to meet up the demand of energy by spending a lot of valuable foreign currency. But utilizing the renewable energy sources that we have in our country especially if we can encourage the people to produce and use biogas, we will be able to change the infrastructure of rural area. We can focus our attention to electricity production using windmill. If we can make the use of solar energy available through research, we will be able to meet up all our demands of energy from this unlimited source. The main advantage of using of renewable energy is that there is no possibility of diminishing of energy. Moreover it will be possible to protect our country from environment pollution. 4.4 Transformation of energy Energy is being transformed continuously from one form to another. Various incidents are taking place in this universe due to transformation of energy. Though energy is transforming from one form to more than one form, the total amount of energy in this universe remains unchanged. Transformation of energy is required for man, computer or any other machine to work or to make any change or to process anything. One form of energy can be used to produce another different form of energy. Actually, one form of energy is simultaneously transforming into another form which is known as the transformation of energy. What happens when anyone plays guitar? The muscle energy of the artist transforms into mechanical energy on the vibrating string which transforms into sound energy as a melodious music and travels to our ears. When wood is burned chemical energy is released and transforms into heat and light energy. A chemical reaction takes place in an electric cell and the chemical energy of these reactions transforms into electric energy which is used for various purposes. When a definite amount of energy of a particular form is transformed how much energy is obtained? It can be known from the law of conservation of energy. When such a transformation takes place there is no net loss of energy. The energy lost by one body is exactly equal to the energy gained by another body. In fact, we can neither create energy nor destroy it. In other words the total energy of the universe does neither increase nor decrease. The amount of energy that existed in the universe at the moment of its creation exists till today. This known as conservation of energy. Principle of Conservation of Energy: Energy can be transformed form one form to another or more forms. The total energy of the universe is constant and unchangeable. 78 trees. Biomass refers to all those organic materials that can transform into energy. Man along with other animals takes biomass as food and keeps their activities of life active by transforming biomass into energy. Biomass can be considered as a multiple source of energy. The organic substances that can be used as the source of energy are \u2013 plants and trees, dry wood, waste of wood, crops, husk of rice, herbs, waste of birds and animals, garbage etc. Biomass is mainly composed of Carbon and Hydrogen. One of the renewable sources of energy is biomass. Biogas can be produced easily from biomass. We can use this gas as the alternate to natural gas and use for cooking even for the production of electricity. The production of biogas is very simple. If we keep cow dung and water in 1:2 ratio in a closed pot for dumping, biogas will be produced. This gas comes out through a tube. This gas is used for cooking. For the cooking and lighting bulbs for a family of 4/5 persons the requirement of gas can be supplied from the cow dung of only 2/3 cows. Nuclear energy Electricity can be produced by using the energy produced in nuclear reaction. The nuclear reaction from which the obtained energy is used to produce electricity is called nuclear fission. Here, uranium is made to react with a neutron of particular amount of energy. This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor. In nuclear reaction usually matter that is mass is transformed into energy. But in nuclear reaction only a small fraction of energy of the total mass is transformed into energy. If mass is transformed and E amount of energy is obtained, then, E = mc2 Here m is the mass transformed into energy. c is the speed of light that is equal to 3 x 108 ms-1. From experiment it is known that in a fission reaction, that is, if a neutron of definite energy strikes a uranium nucleus, then almost 200 Mev = 200 x 106 ev = 200 x 106 x 1.6 x 10-19 J = 3.2 x 10-11 J energy is released. Since nuclear fission is a chain reaction, hence in a moment crores of reactions take place and huge amount of energy is released. Calculate: If a substance of 1kg mass is converted completely into energy, then how many kilowatt energy will be produced? 1 kilowatt-hour (1 kWh) = 3.6 x 106 J The energy obtained from this reaction can be transferred to another container as the internal energy of carbon dioxide, by pumping continuously at high pressure in a controlled way. This heated gas moves around a special steam boiler and heats the steam inside which can rotate a turbine and produce electricity. The amount of energy obtained from a ton of uranium by a nuclear reaction will be equal to the amount of energy obtained from burning ten lac tons of coal. But there are some problems of nuclear power plants. The waste of nuclear fuel is extremely radioactive and so it has to be preserved for thousands of years to make it safe. Moreover, in a nuclear reactor high temperature and pressure is produced. So it has to be made of such a material that can tolerate the high temperature and pressure. Any nuclear accident is very dangerous which we can realize from the accidents of Chernobyl Physics Physics petroleum well. The principal element in a natural gas is the methane gas. These are called fossil energy. The three sources of energy discussed above are reducing very fast due to the men\u2019s increasing demand of energy. The physical condition of the world is such that these sources-coal, mineral oil, natural gas cannot be recreated, these are called nonrenewable energy. So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy from water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc are the main sources. These sources are directly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As long as earth receives sunlight the energy supply from these sources is possible. These are called renewable sources. Solar Energy: The energy that we obtain from the sun is called Solar Energy. It is known to all that the sun is the source of all energy. The origin of all forms of energy is from the solar energy in one way or the other. For an example, the fossil fuel such as coal, mineral, oil, and natural gas is actually a store of solar energy for a long time. From ancient times man is using sunlight directly to dry things. At present man is adopting various means to use the solar energy round the clock. Ignition can be done by concentrating sun\u2019s rays- with the help of a convex lens. Solar cooker consists of a metallic bowl on which the solar rays are reflected. The cooker can be used in cooking purposes. Do it yourself: Take a concave mirror with a focal length of 15cm or 20cm. Hold the mirror facing the sun. Take a piece of paper and concentrate the sunlight with the help of the mirror on it. Hold the mirror till the paper ignites. The solar rays are used to keep the dwelling houses warm in cold countries. Solar energy is used for drying purposes of crops, fish, vegetables etc. Dried fish can be preserved for many days. More examples of solar energy are- solar water heater, solar cooker etc. Solar cell has been made by using modern technology. The characteristics of a solar cell are that the cell produces electricity instantly while solar rays fall upon it. There are various uses of solar cell. 1. This cell is used to supply electricity in artificial satellites. For this reason the artificial satellites move along their orbits for a long time. 2. Solar energy is being used to operate different electronic devices like pocket calculator, pocket radio and electronic watch. 3. Currently electrical energy is produced from solar energy in the rural area, houses or offices to meet up the need of electricity. The advantage of solar energy is that it does not pollute the environment. There is almost no possibility of danger in using this energy. There is also no possibility of sudden exhaustion of solar energy. This is why it is likely to be used as a prospective fuel instead of fossil fuel. Hydroelectricity (Transformation of mechanical energy): Water is one of the renewable sources of energy. Energy can be produced by means of water current and tide and ebb. There are different forms of energy in the water current"

We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force \u00d7 Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, F s NN NN W= Fs\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (4.1) Work has no direction. It is a scalar quantity. Dimension of Work: Figure: 4.Dimension of work will be the dimension of force \u00d7 dimension of displacement Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored Physics or, Work = Force \u00d7 displacement = mass \u00d7 acceleration \u00d7 displacement = mass \u00d7 displacement \u00d7 displacement ( time )2 = mass \u00d7 (displacement)2 ( time )or, W = ML2 T2 \u2234 [W] = [ML2T-2] Unit of work: The unit of work is obtained by multiplying the unit of force with unit of distance. Since the unit of force is Newton (N) and the unit of distance is meter (m) then the unit of work will be newton-meter (Nm) which is called joule. Joule is expressed by J. If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity. Mathematical example 4.1: A man of mass 70kg climbs on a mountain of height 200m. How much work will he do? Given, Mass of man, m = 70kg Force, F = weight of the man = mg = 70kg \u00d7 9.8 ms-2 = 686N Displacement, S = 200m Work, W =? We know, W = Fs = 686N \u00d7 200m = 1.372 \u00d7 105 J Ans: 1.372 \u00d7 105 J 4.2 Energy Nothing can move or work without energy. We need energy for our survival. The amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work. So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work."

Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy. 4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power = Work Time If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be, P = t (4.4) Power has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. Dimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of . Work Time Power = Work Time = Force x Displacement Time = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement Time = Mass x Displacement x Displacement Time x Time2 = Mass x Displacement2 Time3 \u2234 [P] = ML2 T3 = [ML2T-3]"

The main objectives of physics are to establish the relation between matter and energy and to express it quantitatively on the basis of observation, experimentation and analysis. Scope of Physics : Physics is the key of all science. It is the fundamental branch of science because the foundation of other subjects is based on the principles of physics. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a basic principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Starting from Engineering to Medical Science, Astronomy to Oceanology, Biology to Psychology the instruments of Physics are used. For the systematic study of physics, we can divide it into the following branches : (1) Mechanics (2) Heat and thermodynamics (3) Sound (4) Optics (5) Electricity and Magnetism (6) Solid State Physics (7) Atomic Physics (8) Nuclear Physics (9) Quantum Physics and (10) Electronics Development of physics: Modern civilization is the product of science. Behind this development of science there are untiring efforts, discoveries and innovation of scientists. Science has no national or political boundaries. The growth, development and benefit of science are enjoyed by all people of all nations. From ancient time scientist have been contributing for the development of science. In this lesson we will try to mention the contributions of physicists. Thales (624-569 B.C) is famous for his predictions regarding solar eclipse. He also knew about the magnetic properties of loadstone. Pythagoras (527-497 B.C) is a memorable name in the history of science. Beside the invention of several Geometric theorem, he made longer lasting contribution through his works on vibrating string. He was given several Geometric theorem .Moreover, he made long lasting contributions through his works on vibrating strings. The present scales of musical instruments and music are partially the contributions of his research on the vibration of strings. Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 B.C) gave the idea that the matter consists of indivisible units. He called it atom. His concept about atom was significant even though it is completely different from the present concept. Greek scientist Archimedes (287-212 B.C) discovered the principles of lever and the law of upward force acting on bodies immersed in liquid and was able to determine the impurity in metals. He also knew the technique of setting fire by concentrating sun rays with the help of spherical mirrors. After Archimedes, scientific discoveries advanced rather slowly for a few centuries. In fact scientific discoveries did not revive in Europe before the thirteenth century. During Physics Physics 14.1 Basis of bio-physics Bio-physics is such a branch of science which is developed on the basis of a number of branches of science. Theories and methods of physical science are employed in biophysics to study a system of biology. Biology is the science of studying living world. How plants and animals collect food, communicate, percept from the environment and reproduce are discussed in biology. On the other hand the mathematical rule which nature follows is the subject-matter of physics. For a long period, the scientists believed that the laws of living world and physical world are different. But with the progress of physical and biological science, a deep harmony is found between these two apparently different disciplines. At first physics and biology has evolved as two different subjects. The mutual relationship and coordination between these two subjects has increased a lot with the advancement of science. It was thought before that living world follows a different rule and the laws of physical science are applicable only for the inanimate objects. But now we know that the animal body can be compared to a machine from many aspects and it is possible to explain many behaviors of animal body with the help of physical laws. Actually, the laws of physics are universal. So, not only the physical world, but also the animal kingdom can be explained with the help of physics in many cases. This is the basis of bio-physics. The challenge of bio-physics is to explain different complexities of life on the basis of simple laws of physics. Bio-physics is a powerful tool to reach at the depth of life by investigating different secrets of life and analyzing different events using mathematics and physics. Bio-physics is a bridge between biology and physics. 14.2 Contributions of Jagadish Chandra Bose Acharya Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was a physicist as well as a biologist. In our sub- continent he is the first internationally recognized scientist. Bose family hailed from the village Rarikhal of Bikrampur under district of Dhaka. He was born in Mymensingh on 30th November, 1958. His father Bhagawan Chandra Bose was a deputy magistrate in the district of Faridpur. Bose\u2019s education started at a vernacular school in Faridpur. Next he got admitted to Hare school and Saint Xavier\u2019s school and college in Kolkata and passed his student life. After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the year 1880. His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research. He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated"

Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time taken to do that work. The standard unit for power is the Watt (W), which is equivalent to one Joule per second (1 J/s).",
        "referenceContext": "Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.",
        "context": "Physics Unit: We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-Since watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier. Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., .

In the beginning of this chapter we will present this concept. The most important topic in science is energy. From our experience we see that the world becomes inactive without energy. We get energy in different forms. Such as kinetic energy for motion, potential energy for object in higher position from the ground, the energy of spring at contract condition or expanding condition, heat energy of hot body, electrical energy of charged body etc. The energy is transforming from one form to another gradually although the total energy of the universe remains unchanged and constant. In this chapter we will discuss about the transformation of energy and the law of conservation of energy, one of the important laws of science.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to - 1. Explain the relation between work and energy. 2. Establish the relation among work, force and displacement. \u20183: 3. Explain kinetic and potential energy. 4. Explain the transformation of energy in its source. 5. Analyze the contribution of the source of energy regarding economic, social and environmental influence. 6. Explain the relation between transformation of energy and conservation of energy. 7. Explain transformation of energy and how its uses hamper the balance of environment. 8. Explain the effective use of energy in developing activities. 9. Be conscious about the effective and safe use of energy. 10. Explain the mass-energy relation. 11. Establish the relation between transmission of energy and power. 12. Measure the efficiency. Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored"

        "referenceAnswer": "In everyday language, 'work' refers to any activity, even if it doesn't involve force or displacement. In physics, 'work' is specifically defined as the force applied to an object that causes it to move a certain distance.  So, while someone sitting at a desk might be considered to be 'working' in everyday language, in physics, no work is done because there is no displacement.",
        "referenceContext": "Work means to do something in our everyday life but in science doing anything is not work. In science the term work represents a definite concept. A gateman guards a house all day long sitting at a place and can say he has done his work. A boat was floating with the current of a river or canal and Mr. Karim was pulling it back. He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done.

        "context": "Physics 4.1 Work: Work means to do something in our everyday life but in science doing anything is not work. In science the term work represents a definite concept.

Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done. The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc. Let us consider the following examples: a) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand. b) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. c) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. d) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force \u00d7 Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, F s NN NN W= Fs\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (4.1) Work has no direction. It is a scalar quantity. Dimension of Work: Figure: 4.Dimension of work will be the dimension of force \u00d7 dimension of displacement Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another.

Since the unit of force is Newton (N) and the unit of distance is meter (m) then the unit of work will be newton-meter (Nm) which is called joule. Joule is expressed by J. If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity. Mathematical example 4.1: A man of mass 70kg climbs on a mountain of height 200m. How much work will he do? Given, Mass of man, m = 70kg Force, F = weight of the man = mg = 70kg \u00d7 9.8 ms-2 = 686N Displacement, S = 200m Work, W =? We know, W = Fs = 686N \u00d7 200m = 1.372 \u00d7 105 J Ans: 1.372 \u00d7 105 J 4.2 Energy Nothing can move or work without energy. We need energy for our survival. The amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work. So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work."

        "referenceAnswer": "The two primary forms of mechanical energy are kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. The faster an object moves, the more kinetic energy it has. Potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration.

        "context": "Physics Transformation of energy: We have mentioned earlier about different forms of energy. All of them are related to one another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy transformation are described below. 1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy. 2. Transformation of heat Energy: In steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. 3. Transformation of light energy: If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is transformed into chemical energy. 4. Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 5. Transformation of electrical energy: In electric motor electric energy is transformed into mechanical energy. In instruments like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy: In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy. Physics Chapter Two MOTION (\u00a2 =l = .1 ~ /6 [Z /Yo [The object, that we see around us either are stationery or in motion. What do we actually understand by the words ``rest\u2019\u2019 and ``motion\u2019\u2019. We need different quantities regarding motion to express the characteristics of motion of a moving object. In this chapter we will discuss different quantities regarding motion, their dimensions, units, the relations among them etc.] By the end of this chapter we will be able to- 1. Explain the rest and motion 2. Find out the difference among different types of motion. 3. Explain the scalar and vector quantities 4. Analyze the relation among the quantities regarding motion 5. Explain the motion of freely falling bodies 6. Analyze the relations among the quantities regarding motion with the help of graph 7. Realize the effect of motion in our life Physics this motion is called vibratory motion. Motion of a simple pendulum, motion of vibrating tuning fork and the motion of string of guitar. 2.3 Scalar and vector quantities : Anything that can be measured in this physical world is called a physical quantity. When a physical quantity is measured, it has got a magnitude. We express this magnitude in terms of a number and a unit. For example, if we say that the height of the bench is 1.5 meter, we mean that the unit of length is meter and height of the bench is 1.5 times this unit. But all physical quantities cannot be completely expressed by its magnitude only. To express not only magnitude of some quantities is needed but also the direction. For example, if we say that a car is running at the speed of 40 km per hour, it is understood that the car moves a distance 40 km in one hour, but the direction of motion of the car cannot be known from this statement. To know the actual position of the car, the direction of the motion should also be stated. So, we can see, to express some of the quantities completely direction is needed with the magnitude of the quantities. In consideration of direction all quantities of the world we can divide into two category. Such as 1. In-directional quantity or Scalar quantity 2. Directional quantity or Vector quantity Scalar quantity : Physical quantities which can be fully expressed by magnitude only are called scalar quantities. Length, mass, speed, work, energy, time, temperature etc are the examples of scalar quantities. Vector quantity : Physical quantity which need both magnitude and direction to be fully expressed are called vector quantities. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, electric intensity etc are the examples of vector quantities. Table 2.1 Shows that vectors are expressed by magnitude and direction whereas scalars are expressed by magnitude only. Table 2.1 Examples of scalar and vector quantities Scalar Quantity Vector quantity Distance d 40m Displacement s 40m east direction Speed v 30ms-1 Velocity v 30 ms-1 north direction Time t 15s Force F 100N upward direction Energy E 2000j Acceleration a 98ms-2 downward direction"

General Question: 1. A match stick is rubbed with its box with a force of 5N. The stick is dragged 5cm. a) What is the energy used in rubbing? b) What is the power needed if it takes 0.5s to drag the stick? 2. The reservoir of a hydro-electric project is 800m high from the sea level and the power station is 250m high. The water of reservoir rotates a turbine coming through the pipe. There is 20 x 108 liter water in the reservoir. If the mass of 1 liter water is 1kg find the potential energy stored in the water of the reservoir. 3. A boy of 40kg can reach the roof by the stairs in 12s. The number of steps of the stairs is 20 and height of each step is 20cm. a) What is the weight of the boy? b) What is the height the boy reached on? c) What is the work done to reach the roof? d) What is the power he used to reach the roof? 4. It is more advantageous to produce nuclear energy than the power station that uses fuel because no green house gas is produced. a) What are the other advantages of using nuclear energy? b) What are the disadvantages of using nuclear energy? Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy. 4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power = Work Time If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be, P = t (4.4) Power has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. Dimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of . Work Time Power = Work Time = Force x Displacement Time = Mass x Acceleration x Displacement Time = Mass x Displacement x Displacement Time x Time2 = Mass x Displacement2 Time3 \u2234 [P] = ML2 T3 = [ML2T-3]"

        "referenceAnswer": "Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transformed. It tells us how quickly work is being performed. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time taken to do that work. The standard unit for power is the Watt (W), which is equivalent to one Joule per second (1 J/s).",
        "referenceContext": "Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.",
        "context": "Physics Unit: We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-Since watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier. Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., . Total Time Perform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them. Who is the most powerful student in your class?

Establish the relation between transmission of energy and power. 12. Measure the efficiency. Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored"

        "referenceAnswer": "Nuclear energy offers advantages like generating large amounts of electricity with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. However, it also has disadvantages such as the risk of accidents, the challenge of storing radioactive waste, and the potential for misuse for weapons.  Nuclear energy is considered non-renewable because uranium, the fuel for nuclear reactors, is a finite resource.",
        "referenceContext": "Electricity can be produced by using the energy produced in nuclear reaction. The nuclear reaction from which the obtained energy is used to produce electricity is called nuclear fission. Here, uranium is made to react with a neutron of particular amount of energy. This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor.",
        "context": "Physics in Soviet Union (at present Ukraine) and Fukushima in Japan. In nuclear power production less greenhouse gas is released in the environment. The Social Effects and Advantages of Renewable Energy Uses of renewable energy have a far-reaching effect on our social life. In comparison with the demand of our country the storage of coal, petroleum and natural gas is very poor. So, we have to import mineral oil and coal from abroad to meet up the demand of energy by spending a lot of valuable foreign currency. But utilizing the renewable energy sources that we have in our country especially if we can encourage the people to produce and use biogas, we will be able to change the infrastructure of rural area. We can focus our attention to electricity production using windmill. If we can make the use of solar energy available through research, we will be able to meet up all our demands of energy from this unlimited source. The main advantage of using of renewable energy is that there is no possibility of diminishing of energy. Moreover it will be possible to protect our country from environment pollution. 4.4 Transformation of energy Energy is being transformed continuously from one form to another. Various incidents are taking place in this universe due to transformation of energy. Though energy is transforming from one form to more than one form, the total amount of energy in this universe remains unchanged. Transformation of energy is required for man, computer or any other machine to work or to make any change or to process anything. One form of energy can be used to produce another different form of energy. Actually, one form of energy is simultaneously transforming into another form which is known as the transformation of energy. What happens when anyone plays guitar? The muscle energy of the artist transforms into mechanical energy on the vibrating string which transforms into sound energy as a melodious music and travels to our ears. When wood is burned chemical energy is released and transforms into heat and light energy. A chemical reaction takes place in an electric cell and the chemical energy of these reactions transforms into electric energy which is used for various purposes. When a definite amount of energy of a particular form is transformed how much energy is obtained? It can be known from the law of conservation of energy. When such a transformation takes place there is no net loss of energy. The energy lost by one body is exactly equal to the energy gained by another body. In fact, we can neither create energy nor destroy it. In other words the total energy of the universe does neither increase nor decrease. The amount of energy that existed in the universe at the moment of its creation exists till today. This known as conservation of energy. Principle of Conservation of Energy: Energy can be transformed form one form to another or more forms. The total energy of the universe is constant and unchangeable. 78 trees. Biomass refers to all those organic materials that can transform into energy. Man along with other animals takes biomass as food and keeps their activities of life active by transforming biomass into energy. Biomass can be considered as a multiple source of energy. The organic substances that can be used as the source of energy are \u2013 plants and trees, dry wood, waste of wood, crops, husk of rice, herbs, waste of birds and animals, garbage etc. Biomass is mainly composed of Carbon and Hydrogen. One of the renewable sources of energy is biomass. Biogas can be produced easily from biomass. We can use this gas as the alternate to natural gas and use for cooking even for the production of electricity. The production of biogas is very simple. If we keep cow dung and water in 1:2 ratio in a closed pot for dumping, biogas will be produced. This gas comes out through a tube. This gas is used for cooking. For the cooking and lighting bulbs for a family of 4/5 persons the requirement of gas can be supplied from the cow dung of only 2/3 cows. Nuclear energy Electricity can be produced by using the energy produced in nuclear reaction. The nuclear reaction from which the obtained energy is used to produce electricity is called nuclear fission. Here, uranium is made to react with a neutron of particular amount of energy. This reaction takes place in a nuclear reactor. In nuclear reaction usually matter that is mass is transformed into energy. But in nuclear reaction only a small fraction of energy of the total mass is transformed into energy. If mass is transformed and E amount of energy is obtained, then, E = mc2 Here m is the mass transformed into energy. c is the speed of light that is equal to 3 x 108 ms-1. From experiment it is known that in a fission reaction, that is, if a neutron of definite energy strikes a uranium nucleus, then almost 200 Mev = 200 x 106 ev = 200 x 106 x 1.6 x 10-19 J = 3.2 x 10-11 J energy is released. Since nuclear fission is a chain reaction, hence in a moment crores of reactions take place and huge amount of energy is released. Calculate: If a substance of 1kg mass is converted completely into energy, then how many kilowatt energy will be produced? 1 kilowatt-hour (1 kWh) = 3.6 x 106 J The energy obtained from this reaction can be transferred to another container as the internal energy of carbon dioxide, by pumping continuously at high pressure in a controlled way. This heated gas moves around a special steam boiler and heats the steam inside which can rotate a turbine and produce electricity. The amount of energy obtained from a ton of uranium by a nuclear reaction will be equal to the amount of energy obtained from burning ten lac tons of coal. But there are some problems of nuclear power plants. The waste of nuclear fuel is extremely radioactive and so it has to be preserved for thousands of years to make it safe. Moreover, in a nuclear reactor high temperature and pressure is produced. So it has to be made of such a material that can tolerate the high temperature and pressure. Any nuclear accident is very dangerous which we can realize from the accidents of Chernobyl Physics Physics petroleum well. The principal element in a natural gas is the methane gas. These are called fossil energy. The three sources of energy discussed above are reducing very fast due to the men\u2019s increasing demand of energy. The physical condition of the world is such that these sources-coal, mineral oil, natural gas cannot be recreated, these are called nonrenewable energy. So men are looking for alternate sources of energy of which solar energy, energy from water flow, energy from tide and ebb, geothermal energy, wind energy, biomass etc are the main sources. These sources are directly or indirectly dependent on the sun. As long as earth receives sunlight the energy supply from these sources is possible. These are called renewable sources. Solar Energy: The energy that we obtain from the sun is called Solar Energy. It is known to all that the sun is the source of all energy. The origin of all forms of energy is from the solar energy in one way or the other. For an example, the fossil fuel such as coal, mineral, oil, and natural gas is actually a store of solar energy for a long time. From ancient times man is using sunlight directly to dry things. At present man is adopting various means to use the solar energy round the clock. Ignition can be done by concentrating sun\u2019s rays- with the help of a convex lens. Solar cooker consists of a metallic bowl on which the solar rays are reflected. The cooker can be used in cooking purposes. Do it yourself: Take a concave mirror with a focal length of 15cm or 20cm. Hold the mirror facing the sun. Take a piece of paper and concentrate the sunlight with the help of the mirror on it. Hold the mirror till the paper ignites. The solar rays are used to keep the dwelling houses warm in cold countries. Solar energy is used for drying purposes of crops, fish, vegetables etc. Dried fish can be preserved for many days. More examples of solar energy are- solar water heater, solar cooker etc. Solar cell has been made by using modern technology. The characteristics of a solar cell are that the cell produces electricity instantly while solar rays fall upon it. There are various uses of solar cell. 1. This cell is used to supply electricity in artificial satellites. For this reason the artificial satellites move along their orbits for a long time. 2. Solar energy is being used to operate different electronic devices like pocket calculator, pocket radio and electronic watch. 3. Currently electrical energy is produced from solar energy in the rural area, houses or offices to meet up the need of electricity. The advantage of solar energy is that it does not pollute the environment. There is almost no possibility of danger in using this energy. There is also no possibility of sudden exhaustion of solar energy. This is why it is likely to be used as a prospective fuel instead of fossil fuel. Hydroelectricity (Transformation of mechanical energy): Water is one of the renewable sources of energy. Energy can be produced by means of water current and tide and ebb. There are different forms of energy in the water current"

In everyday language, 'work' can refer to any activity, even if it doesn't involve force or displacement. For example, sitting all day might be considered 'work' in everyday language, but in physics, no work has been done because there's no displacement.",

He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done.

The concept of work in science is different from that of daily life. In fact in science work is done when displacement is associated with force. So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example, bull pulls the plough; a laborer pushes forward a push cart, someone throws iron sphere is sports competition etc. Let us consider the following examples: a) Ratan is standing still with a packet of book in his hand. b) Mita is pushing her physics book from one end to another of a table. c) Niru is lifting a heavy bag through stairs. d) Rimi is pushing the wall strongly. As work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done. If a construction laborer wants to get to the second floor of a building with ten bricks, he has to do more work than that of lifting a single brick to the same place as he has to use more force. He has to do more work if he wants to lift those brick on the third floor. Therefore, the amount of work depends on the applied force and the distance. Work is measured by the product of applied force on a body and its displacement along the direction of force. Therefore, Work = Force \u00d7 Distance travelled along the direction of force If a force F is applied on a body and the body travels a distance s along the direction of force (fig: 4.1) then the work done (W) will be, F s NN NN W= Fs\u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (4.1) Work has no direction.

Since the unit of force is Newton (N) and the unit of distance is meter (m) then the unit of work will be newton-meter (Nm) which is called joule. Joule is expressed by J. If a force of 1N is applied on a body and the body gets a displacement of 1m along the direction of force then the work done is said to be 1joule (1J), i.e. 1J = 1Nm. If the displacement takes place along the direction of force then work done is said to be work done by the force. If a duster falls on a floor from a table the work is done here by the force of gravity. If the displacement of a body takes place opposite to the direction of force then the work done is called work done against force. If a duster is lifted on the top of a table from the floor then the work is done against the force of gravity. This is because the displacement takes place opposite to the direction of the force of gravity. Mathematical example 4.1: A man of mass 70kg climbs on a mountain of height 200m.

The amount of work we do everyday depends on our energy level. We get energy from the food we take. Plants need energy for growth. Engine also needs energy for its functioning. Some engines use electricity and some need fuel for energy. Energy is stored in fuel. What do we mean by energy? The energy of a body means its ability to work. So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work."

In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy transformation are described below. 1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy. 2. Transformation of heat Energy: In steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. 3. Transformation of light energy: If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is transformed into chemical energy. 4. Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 5. Transformation of electrical energy: In electric motor electric energy is transformed into mechanical energy. In instruments like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy: In nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy. Physics 81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy. 4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power = Work Time If as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be, P = t (4.4) Power has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. Dimension: The dimension of power is the dimension of .

        "question": "What is the law of conservation of energy? Explain its significance in understanding energy transformations.",
        "answer": "The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. This means that energy can be transformed from one form to another, but the total amount of energy remains the same. The law of conservation of energy can be mathematically expressed as:\n\n\u0394E = Q - W\n\nwhere \u0394E is the change in energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system.\n\nThe significance of the law of conservation of energy lies in its ability to explain the transformations of energy and the fact that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. This law has far-reaching implications in various fields, including physics, engineering, and economics, and is a fundamental concept in understanding the behavior of energy in the universe.",

All of them are related to one another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy transformation are described below. 1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy. 2. Transformation of heat Energy: In steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy. 3. Transformation of light energy: If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is transformed into chemical energy. 4. Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy.

        "answer": "Power is the rate of doing work or the rate of transformation of energy. It is defined as the work done per unit time. The unit of power is Joule/second (J/s) or Watt (W).",
        "referenceAnswer": "Power in physics is the rate at which work is done or energy is transformed. It tells us how quickly work is being performed. Power is calculated by dividing the work done by the time taken to do that work. The standard unit for power is the Watt (W), which is equivalent to one Joule per second (1 J/s).  Another unit is horsepower (hp), which is equivalent to 746 watts.",
        "referenceContext": "Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.",
        "context": "Physics Unit: We can get the unit of power by dividing the unit of work with that of time. Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W. If one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt. 1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-Since watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used. 1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier. Still today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car. 1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices. Mathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch. Your work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., . Total Time Perform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them. Who is the most powerful student in your class? Physics When we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use. The energy of a body refers to its ability to work. Here work means the transformation of energy from one form to another. It means that the total amount of work that a body can do is its energy. The amount of work a body can do is the measure of its energy. So, the amount of work done is the amount of energy used. Therefore, Work done = Energy used Energy has no direction. So it is a scalar quantity. The unit of energy and work is the same and it is joule (J). Different forms of energy We need different types energy for doing different kinds of work. For example we need heat to boil water. We get light energy from an electric bulb. There is sound energy in the music we hear. We need muscular energy to shift or to lift any object. Electrical energy is necessary to operate an electrical device. We get chemical energy by chemical reaction in the electric cell. A piece of paper flies due to energy of air. Nuclear energy is released when the atoms are accumulated or broken. The universe is in motion as there is energy. If no energy existed the universe would be motionless. As there is light energy we can see and hear because of sound energy. We can move for mechanical energy. Fan rotates and factory runs with the help of electric energy. Energy exists in the universe in different forms. Generally we observe the following forms of energy. Such as, mechanical energy, heat energy, sound energy, light energy, magnetic energy, electrical energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy and solar energy. The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object. Kinetic Energy: We sometimes notice that cricket ball hits the stamp and strikes it down. If anything hard hits the glass of window the glass breaks down. If we throw stones at mango or jujube it may fall down. From the above example we can see energy exists in the body in motion. The capacity of doing work acquired by a moving body due to its motion is called kinetic energy. Do it yourself: Keep a pen on a table or a desk in front of you. Put a light object before the pen. Hit the pen by your finger towards the object. Why does the object displace from its initial position? This is because the hit makes the pen move and the pen obtains the ability to work that is kinetic energy is produced in it. So it could displace the object. Creating velocity in a body in rest or increasing the velocity of a moving object means to produce acceleration in it. For this force has to be applied. As a result work will be done on the body. For this the body will obtain the ability to work and this work will be stored Physics So, the physical quantities which are independent or neutral that is, they do not depend on other quantity, rather other quantities depend on them, are called fundamental quantities. Scientists have identified seven such quantities as fundamental quantities which are used in all branches of science for measurement. These are (1) length (2) mass (3) time (4) temperature (5) electric current (6) luminous intensity and (7) amount of substance. All other quantities may be derived from fundamental quantities that means, these are obtained from the product or quotient of one or more fundamental quantities. These are called derived quantities or compound quantities. So, the quantities depend on fundamental quantities or obtain from fundamental quantities are called derived quantities. Velocity, acceleration, force, work, heat, electric current etc. are derived quantities since these are obtain from fundamental quantities. For instance, force = mass x acceleration = mass \u00d7 velocity time [ acceleration = velocity time ] = mass \u00d7 distance time \u00d7 1 time [ velocity = distance time ] distance = mass \u00d7 time2 Hence, force is a derived quantity. 1.5 Units of measurements Measurement is related to most of our daily activities. Moreover, we need accurate measurement for various research works. The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu\u2019s home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school\u2019s office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter\u2019s unit. There are different"

Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F/A\\ni.e.  Pressure = Force\\nIt is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P.",
        "context": "Physics 5.1 Pressure and Area Can you stand on a single leg easily that you can do by using your two legs? The shoes pierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so wearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain. More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end. When force is applied on the flat end of the blunt pin, less pressure is exerted on the blunt end .So, it is easy to hole a paper by a sharper pin. Physics Verify: Which one is more painful to walk bare footed on plain bricks soling road or a brick chucked road? Explain Unit of pressure: If we divide the unit of force by the unit of area, we get the unit of pressure. Therefore the unit of pressure is Nm-2. It is called pascal (Pa). \u2234 1Pa = 1Nm-If a force of 1N force is applied perpendicularly to an area of 1m2, then the pressure generated is known as 1Pa. Mathematical Example 5.1: The mass of a woman wearing a shoe is 50kg. The area of the bottom of the shoe is 200cm2. Find the pressure. We know. Pressure P = F/A = W/A 490N 200\u00d710 -4 m 2 = 2.45\u00d7104Pa Given, mass, m=50kg force, F = w = mg = 50kg\u00d79.8ms-2 = 490N Area of the bottom of the shoe, A = 200cm2 = 200\u00d710-4m2 5.2: Density The space occupied by a body is called its volume. If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3. Task: Take two jugs of equal volume. Fill up one jug with water and the other with honey. Lift both the jugs by your hands. Which one is felt heavier? The jug filled with honey will appear heavier because the density of honey is more. Physics Solution Given, We know, Depth of the liquid, h=75cm = 0.75m P= h\u03c1g Density of the liquid, \u03c1 = 800 kgm-or, P=0.75 m x 800 kgm'3 x 9.8 ms\u2122 Acceleration due to gravity, g= 9.8ms-= 5880Pa Pressure P =? Ans: 5880Pa 5.7 Pressure of a fluid and buoyancy A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. R e R \u2014\u2014 I P R . Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93"

Uses of density in every day life: The balloons are released in different inaugural ceremonies. The balloons are puffed of by hydrogen gas. The density of hydrogen is Figur: 5.2 considerably less than the density of air. So, these light balloons filled with gas go up easily. When electricity goes off many of us use IPS and huge battery is used in an IPS. This type of battery known as storage cell is also used in cars and microphones. Sulphuric acid used in these cells has density ranging from 1.5x103kgm-3 to 1.3x103kgm-3. Sometimes, hydrometer is used to measure the density. The cell will damage if the density of acid increases. For this reason necessary amount of water is added to it time to time to keep the density at desired level. Eggs sink in water, but rotten eggs remain floating. As the density of the rotten egg is less than the water, it floats on water Mathematical example 5.2: what is the density of liquid of mass 2000kg and volume 2m3? We know, Given Density,\u03c1 = mass/volume = m/v = 2000kg 2m3 = 1000 kgm-Mass, m = 2000 kg volume, v = 2m3 Density, \u03c1= ? 5.3 Atmospheric pressure This earth is surrounded by air. Atmosphere has weight. So it has pressure. This very pressure on earth surface is almost 105N per square meter. The atmospheric pressure is 1.5x105N on the body of an adult if the area of his body is 1.5m2. As the internal blood pressure of a human body is greater to some extent than the atmospheric pressure, generally it is not felt by the people. The atmosphere for its weight applies force on the earth\u2019s surface and the amount of force acting perpendicularly on per-unit surface area of the earth, is called atmospheric pressure. Physics compels the liquid to take the shape of the container in which it is kept. In solid substances the particles remain very close to each other and very strong attractive force exists in them which give the solid substance a definite size and volume. 5. The molecules move at random in liquid and gas. So, these molecules collide among themselves and also on the surface of the walls of the container. 5.13. Plasma state of matter The forth state of matter is called plasma state. This plasma is the ionized gas at very high temperature. The main source of plasma is the Sun. Except this the other stars are also the sources of plasma. The plasma state is formed at a few thousand degrees of temperature. Plasma has no definite shape and volume like gases. The plasma particles carry charges and act as conductor of electricity. Metals substances are cut by plasma torch in the industry.

        "context": "Physics with the change of vapor in air. We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure by observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. 1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. 5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid. In fig. 5.5 some liquid is kept in a vessel. Let the area of the base of the vessel = A density of the liquid = \u03c1 depth of the liquid = h acceleration due to gravity = g We know, pressure = force \u00f7 area Now, the force acting on area A = weight of the liquid = mass of the liquid \u00d7 g - .

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase Figur: 5.6 of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6).

We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain. More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end.

If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3.

Objects denser than water will sink, while less dense objects will float.  This principle explains why ships can stay afloat even though they're made of heavy materials.

This decrease in pressure can lead to changes in weather patterns, such as the formation of high and low-pressure systems, which can influence the movement of air masses and the development of weather phenomena like storms and clear skies.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface. It's higher at sea level due to the greater weight of the air column above.  As altitude increases, the air column above becomes thinner, leading to a decrease in atmospheric pressure. This is why it's difficult to breathe at high altitudes, as the reduced pressure makes it harder for oxygen to enter our lungs. Changes in atmospheric pressure are a key driver of weather patterns.  When air pressure is high, it indicates a stable atmosphere, typically leading to clear skies. Conversely, low pressure areas signify unstable conditions and often result in stormy weather. This happens because low pressure areas create a pressure gradient, causing air to rush in from high-pressure regions.  The movement of air masses due to these pressure differences leads to cloud formation, precipitation, and other weather events.",

The atmospheric pressure is\\n1.5x105N on the body of an adult if the area of his body is 1.5m2. As the internal blood pressure of a human body is greater to some extent than the atmospheric pressure, generally it is not felt by the people.\\nThe atmosphere for its weight applies force on the earth's surface and the amount of force acting perpendicularly on per-unit surface area of the earth, is called atmospheric pressure.\\n\\n\\nTorricelli's experiment and the measure of atmospheric pressure\\nTake a glass tube about one meter long opened at one end having uniform diameter.

Take this inverted end of the tube along with your finger inside the pure mercury contained in a container. Now remove the finger and take necessary steps to keep the tube vertical. It will be observed that the mercury has come down to some extent and has attained a steady position. It might appear apparently that the mercury inside the tube is in standing position by itself. But in reality it is not so. It happens so due to air pressure. Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container. This pressure is convoyed through the mercury and acts in the upward direction in the tube. This very pressure holds the mercury column\\n\\nof the tube. In absence of this pressure the mercury of the tube will come down due to the force of gravity. Therefore, atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the mercury column of the tube. Generally the height of the mercury column that remains in the tube in about 76cm i.e. the air pressure supports the pressure of 76cm column of mercury. In this way using the height of a liquid the atmospheric pressure can be measured.\\nThe space that remains just above the mercury column in the tube up to its closed end is totally empty. This empty space is termed as Torricelli's vacuum. Only a scarce amount of mercury vapor exists there. The apparatus used to measure the air pressure is called barometer.\\n5.4 : Altitude and atmospheric pressure\\nThe atmospheric pressure depends on the density and height of the atmosphere. On the earth's surface and on sea level the normal air pressure is 76cm of mercury pressure. With the increase of altitude from the sea-level the weight and density of air-column decreases. So, the air pressure reduces with the increase of height. The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is\\n\\nabout 30% of the sea-level air pressure.

There is a possibility of bleeding from the nose at high altitude as atmospheric pressure is considerably low there. Nowadays normal pressure is kept inside a plane for the convenience of the passengers when it flies at a very high altitude and low pressure region. With the increase of height from the earth's surface the pressure of the atmosphere decreases. The change of pressure of the atmosphere with altitude is shown in the graph [Fig: 5.4].",
        "context": "Physics with the change of vapor in air. We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure by observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. 1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. 5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid.

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase Figur: 5.6 of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6).

The area of the exposed surface of the liquid: Evaporation increases as the area of the exposed surface of the liquid increases. Nature of liquid: The rates of evaporation of different liquids are different. Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum. Pressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease of pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum. Liquid and the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases then the rate of evaporation will increase. Effect of dryness: The more the dryness of the air over the liquid surface i.e. the less the amount of water vapor in the air more will be the rate of evaporation. The soaked cloths dry up quickly in winter because air remains dry at that time. 6.14 Thermal Capacity: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a body through 1K is called the heat capacity of that body. The heat capacity depends on the material and the mass of the body. Its unit is JK-1. The heat capacity of a body is 10JK-1 means 10J heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K.

We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge.

Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93"

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase Figur: 5.6 of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6).

Fill the whole tube with pure mercury. Close the open end of the tube tightly with finger and invert the tube. Take this inverted end of the tube along with your finger inside the pure mercury contained in a container. Now remove the finger and take necessary steps to keep the tube vertical. It will be observed that the mercury has come down to some extent and has attained a steady position. It might appear apparently that the mercury inside the tube is in standing position by itself. But in reality it is not so. It happens so due to air pressure. Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container. This Torricelli\u2019s vacuum cm pressure is convoyed through the mercury and acts in the upward direction in the tube. This very pressure holds the mercury column Figur: 5.3 of the tube. In absence of this pressure the mercury of the tube will come down due to the force of gravity. Therefore, atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the mercury column of the tube. Generally the height of the mercury column that remains in the tube in about 76cm i.e. the air pressure supports the pressure of 76cm column of mercury. In this way using the height of a liquid the atmospheric pressure can be measured. The space that remains just above the mercury column in the tube up to its closed end is totally empty. This empty space is termed as Torricelli\u2019s vacuum. Only a scarce amount of mercury vapor exists there. The apparatus used to measure the air pressure is called barometer. 5.4: Altitude and atmospheric pressure The atmospheric pressure depends on the density and height of the atmosphere. On the earth\u2019s surface and on sea level the normal air pressure is 76cm of mercury pressure. With the increase of altitude from the sea-level the weight and density of air-column decreases. So, the air pressure reduces with the increase of height. The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. For this reason Figur: 5.4 respiration becomes difficult at such a high level. There is a possibility of bleeding from the nose at high altitude as atmospheric pressure is considerably low there. Nowadays normal pressure is kept inside a plane for the convenience of the passengers when it flies at a very high altitude and low pressure region. With the increase of height from the earth\u2019s surface the pressure of the atmosphere decreases. The change of pressure of the atmosphere with altitude is shown in the graph [Fig: 5.4]. 5.5 Change in atmospheric pressure and weather With the change of time the atmospheric pressure of a certain place also changes. The variation of water vapor in air is the cause of this change. The density of air also changes"

        "question": "What is pressure and how is it calculated?",
        "answer": "Pressure is the force exerted perpendicularly to unit area of a surface. It is calculated as P = F/A, where P is pressure, F is force, and A is area.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Pressure is defined as the force exerted perpendicularly on a unit area of a body.  It can be calculated using the formula: Pressure = Force / Area. This means that pressure is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to the area over which the force is distributed.",
        "referenceContext": "The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F/A\\ni.e.  Pressure = Force / Area\\nIt is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P.",
        "context": "Physics 5.1 Pressure and Area Can you stand on a single leg easily that you can do by using your two legs? The shoes pierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so wearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain. More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end. When force is applied on the flat end of the blunt pin, less pressure is exerted on the blunt end .So, it is easy to hole a paper by a sharper pin. Physics Verify: Which one is more painful to walk bare footed on plain bricks soling road or a brick chucked road? Explain Unit of pressure: If we divide the unit of force by the unit of area, we get the unit of pressure. Therefore the unit of pressure is Nm-2. It is called pascal (Pa). \u2234 1Pa = 1Nm-If a force of 1N force is applied perpendicularly to an area of 1m2, then the pressure generated is known as 1Pa. Mathematical Example 5.1: The mass of a woman wearing a shoe is 50kg. The area of the bottom of the shoe is 200cm2. Find the pressure. We know. Pressure P = F/A = W/A 490N 200\u00d710 -4 m 2 = 2.45\u00d7104Pa Given, mass, m=50kg force, F = w = mg = 50kg\u00d79.8ms-2 = 490N Area of the bottom of the shoe, A = 200cm2 = 200\u00d710-4m2 5.2: Density The space occupied by a body is called its volume. If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3. Task: Take two jugs of equal volume. Fill up one jug with water and the other with honey. Lift both the jugs by your hands. Which one is felt heavier? The jug filled with honey will appear heavier because the density of honey is more. Physics Solution Given, We know, Depth of the liquid, h=75cm = 0.75m P= h\u03c1g Density of the liquid, \u03c1 = 800 kgm-or, P=0.75 m x 800 kgm'3 x 9.8 ms\u2122 Acceleration due to gravity, g= 9.8ms-= 5880Pa Pressure P =? Ans: 5880Pa 5.7 Pressure of a fluid and buoyancy A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. R e R \u2014\u2014 I P R . Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93"

        "referenceAnswer": "Density is a measure of how much mass is contained within a given volume. It's calculated by dividing the mass of an object by its volume. Density plays a crucial role in determining whether an object will float or sink in a fluid. An object denser than the fluid it's submerged in will sink because the weight of the object exceeds the buoyant force acting on it.

        "question": "How does atmospheric pressure change with altitude and what is its relationship with weather?",
        "answer": "Atmospheric pressure decreases with an increase in altitude. The relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude is inversely proportional, as shown in the graph. The decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude is due to the decrease in density and weight of the air column. This decrease in pressure can lead to changes in weather patterns, such as the possibility of storms or clear weather, as explained in the context.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface. It's higher at sea level due to the greater weight of the air column above.  As altitude increases, the air column above becomes thinner, leading to a decrease in atmospheric pressure. Changes in atmospheric pressure are a key driver of weather patterns.  High pressure areas indicate stable atmospheric conditions, typically leading to clear skies. Conversely, low pressure areas signify unstable conditions and often result in stormy weather. This is because low pressure areas create a pressure gradient, causing air to rush in from high-pressure regions, leading to cloud formation, precipitation, and other weather events.",

        "context": "Physics with the change of vapor in air. We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure by observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. 1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. 5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid.

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase Figur: 5.6 of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6).

        "referenceAnswer": "Pressure is defined as the force exerted perpendicularly on a unit area of a body. It's calculated as Pressure = Force / Area. This means pressure is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to the area the force acts upon.  Smaller areas experience greater pressure for the same force, while larger areas experience less pressure.",

The shoes pierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so wearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain. More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end. When force is applied on the flat end of the blunt pin, less pressure is exerted on the blunt end .So, it is easy to hole a paper by a sharper pin.

Explain Unit of pressure: If we divide the unit of force by the unit of area, we get the unit of pressure. Therefore the unit of pressure is Nm-2. It is called pascal (Pa). \u2234 1Pa = 1Nm-If a force of 1N force is applied perpendicularly to an area of 1m2, then the pressure generated is known as 1Pa.

If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3.

Plasma state of matter The forth state of matter is called plasma state. This plasma is the ionized gas at very high temperature. The main source of plasma is the Sun. Except this the other stars are also the sources of plasma. The plasma state is formed at a few thousand degrees of temperature. Plasma has no definite shape and volume like gases. The plasma particles carry charges and act as conductor of electricity. Metals substances are cut by plasma torch in the industry.

        "question": "How does atmospheric pressure change with altitude, and how does it affect weather patterns?",
        "answer": "Atmospheric pressure decreases with an increase in altitude. The decrease in pressure is directly proportional to the decrease in density of the atmosphere. At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is approximately 76cm of mercury pressure. At higher altitudes, such as the peak of Mount Everest, the atmospheric pressure is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. This decrease in pressure can lead to changes in weather patterns, including the possibility of bleeding from the nose and difficulty in respiration.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface.  It's highest at sea level due to the weight of the entire air column above.  As altitude increases, the air column above becomes thinner, leading to a decrease in atmospheric pressure. Changes in atmospheric pressure play a critical role in weather patterns. High pressure areas indicate stable atmospheric conditions, often resulting in clear skies. Conversely, low pressure areas are associated with unstable conditions and often lead to stormy weather.  Low pressure areas create a pressure gradient, causing air to rush in from high-pressure regions, leading to the development of clouds, precipitation, and other weather events.",

With the increase of height from the earth's surface the pressure of the atmosphere decreases. The change of pressure of the atmosphere with altitude is shown in the graph [Fig: 5.4].",
        "context": "Physics with the change of vapor in air. We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure by observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. 1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. 5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid. In fig. 5.5 some liquid is kept in a vessel. Let the area of the base of the vessel = A density of the liquid = \u03c1 depth of the liquid = h acceleration due to gravity = g We know, pressure = force \u00f7 area Now, the force acting on area A = weight of the liquid = mass of the liquid \u00d7 g - .

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase Figur: 5.6 of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6).

On the earth\u2019s surface and on sea level the normal air pressure is 76cm of mercury pressure. With the increase of altitude from the sea-level the weight and density of air-column decreases.

If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3.

        "question": "What is density and how does it influence buoyancy?",
        "answer": "Density is a measure of mass per unit volume of a substance. It is defined as the ratio of mass to volume, typically expressed in units of kg/m\u00b3. Density influences buoyancy as it determines the upward force exerted by a fluid on an object when it is partially or fully submerged. The greater the density of the fluid, the greater the buoyant force, and the more the object will float or rise.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Density is a measure of how much mass is contained within a given volume. It's calculated as Density = Mass / Volume.  Density plays a crucial role in determining whether an object will float or sink in a fluid. An object denser than the fluid it's submerged in will sink because the weight of the object exceeds the buoyant force acting on it. Conversely, an object less dense than the fluid will float because the buoyant force is greater than the object's weight.",

Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h.

So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder.

        "question": "How does atmospheric pressure change with altitude, and how does this affect weather?",
        "answer": "Atmospheric pressure decreases with an increase in altitude. This decrease is due to the decrease in the weight and density of the air column. The atmospheric pressure on the peak of Mount Everest is about 30% of the sea-level air pressure. This decrease in pressure can cause difficulties in respiration and may lead to bleeding from the nose at high altitudes.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface.  It's highest at sea level due to the weight of the entire air column above.  As altitude increases, the air column above becomes thinner, leading to a decrease in atmospheric pressure.  These changes in pressure are a major factor in weather patterns. High pressure areas indicate stable atmospheric conditions, often resulting in clear skies. Conversely, low pressure areas are associated with unstable conditions and often lead to stormy weather.  Low pressure areas create a pressure gradient, causing air to rush in from high-pressure regions, leading to the development of clouds, precipitation, and other weather events.",

        "context": "Physics with the change of vapor in air. We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure by observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. 1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. 5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid. In fig. 5.5 some liquid is kept in a vessel. Let the area of the base of the vessel = A density of the liquid = \u03c1 depth of the liquid = h acceleration due to gravity = g We know, pressure = force \u00f7 area Now, the force acting on area A = weight of the liquid = mass of the liquid \u00d7 g - .

Therefore pressure rises with the increase of depth of the liquid and also increase in density causes the rise of pressure. As pressure rises with the increase Figur: 5.6 of depth, the liquid comes out with more speed from a hole at greater depth (shown in the figure 5.6).

Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93"

        "context": "Physics with the change of vapor in air. We can understand the change of atmospheric pressure by observing the change in the height of the mercury column of a barometer. 1. If the height of the mercury decreases gradually then it would be understood that the pressure of water vapor is gradually increasing because water vapor is lighter than air. It indicates the possibility of rain. 2. All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm. 3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear. By determining the air pressure by a barometer in this way weather can be forecast. 5.6 Pressure at a point in a liquid at equilibrium Pressure at a point in a liquid means a force exerted perpendicularly by the liquid on unit area around that point in the liquid.

We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain.

If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water.

The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3.

Mathematically, it is represented as \u03c1 = m/V, where \u03c1 is the density, m is the mass, and V is the volume.\n\nThe concept of density determines if an object floats or sinks in water based on the principle of buoyancy. According to Archimedes' Principle, an object will float if its density is less than that of the surrounding fluid (water in this case), and it will sink if its density is greater than that of the fluid.\n\nThe density of an object is calculated by dividing its mass by its volume (\u03c1 = m/V). If the density of the object is less than that of water (approximately 1000 kg/m\u00b3), it will float. If the density is greater, it will sink.\n\nFor example, in the given figure, the body has a volume of 52m\u00b3 and a mass of 30mg. The density of the body is \u03c1 = m/V = 30mg / 52m\u00b3 = 0.577 kg/m\u00b3, which is less than that of water. Therefore, the body will float in water.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Density is a measure of how much mass is contained within a given volume. It's calculated as Density = Mass / Volume. Density plays a crucial role in determining whether an object will float or sink in a fluid.

The decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude is directly proportional to the decrease in atmospheric density. As altitude increases, the air pressure decreases, and the air expands.

The decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude affects weather patterns in several ways:\n\n1.  **Low-pressure systems**: As altitude increases, the air pressure decreases, creating low-pressure systems. These systems are characterized by rising air, which cools and condenses, forming clouds and precipitation.\n2.  **High-pressure systems**: Conversely, as altitude decreases, the air pressure increases, creating high-pressure systems. These systems are characterized by sinking air, which warms and dries, leading to clear skies and fair weather.\n3.  **Fronts**: The interaction between high- and low-pressure systems creates fronts, which are boundaries between different air masses.

The area of the exposed surface of the liquid: Evaporation increases as the area of the exposed surface of the liquid increases. Nature of liquid: The rates of evaporation of different liquids are different. Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum. Pressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease of pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum. Liquid and the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases then the rate of evaporation will increase. Effect of dryness: The more the dryness of the air over the liquid surface i.e. the less the amount of water vapor in the air more will be the rate of evaporation. The soaked cloths dry up quickly in winter because air remains dry at that time. 6.14 Thermal Capacity: The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a body through 1K is called the heat capacity of that body. The heat capacity depends on the material and the mass of the body. Its unit is JK-1. The heat capacity of a body is 10JK-1 means 10J heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K.

The shoes pierce into the mud when one walks on soft mud wearing a high hill. But if one does so wearing a flat pair of shoes, then it does not get into the mud. We will see that it happens due to the change of pressure. Fig-5.The force exerted perpendicularly to unit are of a body is called pressure. Let a force F act perpendicularly on area A of a surface, then pressure, P = F A i.e. Pressure = Force Area It is noted that less the area A, more is the pressure P and more the force F, more is the pressure P. Example: (i)The area of the sharp edge of a nail is very small. So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance. (ii)The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small. So, by placing the sharp edge of the knife on a substance if force is applied, then more pressure acts on the substance along edge. Therefore the substance can easily be cut. Do it yourself: Hole a paper by a very sharp pin and by a blunt pin. Which one is easier to hole? Explain. More pressure is felt on the sharper edge of the pin when force is applied on its flat end.

If we drop a piece of cork and a piece of iron of the same volume into water, we see that the piece of cork floats on water but the piece of iron gets submerged into water. We may say in general that the density of iron is more than the density of cork. So, iron gets sunk into water. Though the volume of the substances are the same, actually the more the density, the heavier the object is, and the less the density, the lighter the object is. The mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature. Density is denoted by \u03c1. If the mass of a body is m and its volume is V, then density \u03c1 = m V = mass of the body volume of the body The unit of density is kgm-3.

Density plays a crucial role in determining whether an object will float or sink in a fluid.  An object denser than the fluid it's submerged in will sink because the weight of the object exceeds the buoyant force acting on it.

Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93 Physics 4.

It is in Jordan. Due to Salt and other impurities the density of the water of the sea is so high that man does not get sunk into it. Uses of density in every day life: The balloons are released in different inaugural ceremonies. The balloons are puffed of by hydrogen gas. The density of hydrogen is Figur: 5.2 considerably less than the density of air. So, these light balloons filled with gas go up easily. When electricity goes off many of us use IPS and huge battery is used in an IPS. This type of battery known as storage cell is also used in cars and microphones. Sulphuric acid used in these cells has density ranging from 1.5x103kgm-3 to 1.3x103kgm-3. Sometimes, hydrometer is used to measure the density. The cell will damage if the density of acid increases. For this reason necessary amount of water is added to it time to time to keep the density at desired level. Eggs sink in water, but rotten eggs remain floating. As the density of the rotten egg is less than the water, it floats on water Mathematical example 5.2: what is the density of liquid of mass 2000kg and volume 2m3?

        "answer": "Atmospheric pressure decreases with an increase in altitude. The relationship between atmospheric pressure and altitude is inversely proportional, as shown in the graph. The decrease in atmospheric pressure with altitude is due to the decrease in density and weight of the air column. This decrease in pressure can lead to changes in weather patterns, such as the possibility of storms or clear weather, as explained in the context.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted by the weight of the atmosphere on the Earth's surface. It's highest at sea level due to the weight of the entire air column above. As altitude increases, the air column above becomes thinner, leading to a decrease in atmospheric pressure.  These changes in pressure are a major factor in weather patterns. High pressure areas indicate stable atmospheric conditions, often resulting in clear skies. Conversely, low pressure areas are associated with unstable conditions and often lead to stormy weather.  Low pressure areas create a pressure gradient, causing air to rush in from high-pressure regions, leading to the development of clouds, precipitation, and other weather events.",

It is related to the motion of molecules of substances, as the molecules possess kinetic energy and vibrate in a state of motion. When heat is applied to a body, the motion of the molecules increases, resulting in an increase in kinetic energy.",

        "context": "Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands.

So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance.

Again if the specific heat of the material of a body is S, then S joule heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K. Therefore, to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat required = S joule \u2234 to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of heat required = mS joule It is the heat capacity of the body with a mass of m kg. \u2234Heat capacity, C = mS joule \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 or, Heat capacity = mass \u00d7 specific heat Heat Capacity \u2234 Specific heat = It is the relation between heat capacity and specific heat. 6.17 Fundamental principle of Calorimetry When two bodies of different temperatures are brought in thermal contact then reception and donation of heat take place. The body at higher temperature leaves heat whereas the body at lower temperature receives heat. This give and take will continue until they reach at the thermal equilibrium. If no heat is lost during donation and reception of heat, then the amount of heat given up by the body at higher temperature will be equal to the heat gained by the body at lower temperature. So, Heat lost = Heat gained \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 It is called the principle of Calorimetry.

They are related by the following equation: C = (F-32)/9 * 5 = (K-273)/5 * 9.  The Kelvin scale is the absolute temperature scale, meaning that 0 Kelvin is the absolute zero point where there is no molecular motion.",
        "referenceContext": "A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The\\ntemperature difference between the two fixed points is called the fundamental interval of a thermometer.

There are three scales of temperature in use - Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of these three scales are \u00b0C, \u00b0F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 32\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper fixed point in Celsius scale is 100\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 212\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K.",
        "context": "Physics Establishing a relation among different scales of temperature: Let A and B be the lower fixed point and upper fixed point of a thermometer respectively (figure 6.3). Three more thermometers graduated in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale are kept side by side. The readings of the point P of the thermometer AB in other three scales are C, F and K respectively. Therefore the readings of distance PA in these three scales are C-0, F-32 and K-273 respectively. Since written, PA BA = C-0 100-0 = F-32 212-32 = K-273 373-273 or, C 100 = F-32 180 = K-273 100 or, C 5 = F-32 9 = K-273 (6.1) Equation (6.1) indicates the relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale.

For example, 1\u00b0C temperature = (1+273) K = 274 K temperature. But if the temperature difference is 1K, then it is equal to 1\u00b0C. Mathematical example 6.1:The temperature of body of a healthy man is 98.4\u00b0F. What would be the reading in Celsius scale?

The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. The molecules of liquids and gases move at random in different directions. Kinetic energy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion forces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation of potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the molecules of a substance is called its internal energy. Evidently a part of the internal energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the kinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The temperature difference between the two fixed points is called the fundamental interval of a thermometer. The fundamental interval i.e. ` the space 5] I ] fiE \\in between the two fixed points is divided in different ways to prepare different scales of temperature.

The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 32\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K.

Fig: 6.4 Physics 6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container \u2234Vr = Va + Vg \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.5) 6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature.

Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C.

The body at higher temperature leaves heat whereas the body at lower temperature receives heat. This give and take will continue until they reach at the thermal equilibrium.

        "question": "Explain the concept of thermal expansion and how it affects different states of matter.",
        "answer": "Thermal expansion is the change in size of a substance due to a change in temperature. When a substance is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy and start moving faster, causing them to spread out and occupy more space. This results in an increase in the size of the substance.\n\nThe effect of thermal expansion on different states of matter is as follows:\n\n- Solids: The expansion of solids is the least among the three states of matter. When a solid is heated, the molecules vibrate more rapidly, causing the solid to expand.\n- Liquids: The expansion of liquids is more than that of solids. When a liquid is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy and move faster, causing the liquid to expand.\n- Gases: The expansion of gases is the maximum among the three states of matter. When a gas is heated, the molecules gain kinetic energy and move rapidly, causing the gas to expand.\n\nThe thermal expansion of a substance can be described by the equation:\n\n\u0394L = \u03b1L\u0394T\n\nwhere \u0394L is the change in length, \u03b1 is the coefficient of linear expansion, L is the initial length, and \u0394T is the change in temperature.\n\nThe thermal expansion of a substance can be classified into two types:\n\n- Real expansion: This is the actual expansion of the substance due to the change in temperature.\n- Apparent expansion: This is the expansion of the substance as observed by us, taking into account the expansion of the container.\n\nThe relationship between real expansion and apparent expansion is given by the equation:\n\nVr = Va + Vg\n\nwhere Vr is the real expansion, Va is the apparent expansion, and Vg is the expansion of the container.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume due to temperature changes. Solids experience linear expansion, liquids expand volumetrically, and gases expand the most due to weaker intermolecular forces. The extent of expansion depends on the material's coefficient of thermal expansion.",
        "referenceContext": "Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it.

The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at \u03b81 temperature be l1 and at \u03b82 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 \u2013 l1 And increase of temperature = \u03b82 - \u03b81 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by \u03b1 and it can be expressed as, 2- \u03b1 = \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.2) l1(\u03b82 - \u03b81) Increase in length = Initial length x increase of temperature In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 1K, then -\u00ab | > u \u03b1 = l2 \u2013 l1 = increase in length. Fig: 6.4 Physics 6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container \u2234Vr = Va + Vg \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.5) 6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature.

Three more thermometers graduated in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale are kept side by side. The readings of the point P of the thermometer AB in other three scales are C, F and K respectively. Therefore the readings of distance PA in these three scales are C-0, F-32 and K-273 respectively. Since written, PA BA = C-0 100-0 = F-32 212-32 = K-273 373-273 or, C 100 = F-32 180 = K-273 100 or, C 5 = F-32 9 = K-273 (6.1) Equation (6.1) indicates the relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale.

The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. The molecules of liquids and gases move at random in different directions. Kinetic energy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion forces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation of potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the molecules of a substance is called its internal energy. Evidently a part of the internal energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the kinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point.

        "answer": "Latent heat is the amount of heat required to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. In the case of fusion, the latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat required to change a solid into a liquid at its melting point. This heat is used to break the intermolecular bonds between the molecules, allowing them to move freely and change the state of the substance. The latent heat of fusion is a characteristic property of a substance and is independent of its temperature.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released during a change of state without a change in temperature. The latent heat of fusion is the energy required to melt a solid. This energy is used to overcome the intermolecular forces holding the solid together, allowing it to transition into a liquid.",
        "referenceContext": "Latent heat of fusion: We know, when the temperature of a solid reaches the melting point due to application of heat then the temperature remain unchanged until all the substances transform into liquid.

Physics amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands? = o) / ;| [ P Fig: 6.1 Water at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right hand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. Temperature Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position. The body with more temperature will Fig: 6.2 lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer."

Physics Physics 6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container \u2234Vr = Va + Vg \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.5) 6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas.

Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The temperature difference between the two fixed points is called the fundamental interval of a thermometer. The fundamental interval i.e. ` the space 5] I ] fiE \\in between the two fixed points is divided in different ways to prepare different scales of temperature. There are three scales of temperature in use \u2013 Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of these three scales are \u00b0C, \u00b0F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 32\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper fixed point in Celsius scale is 100\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 212\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K.

Ans: 5880Pa 5.7 Pressure of a fluid and buoyancy A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. R e R \u2014\u2014 I P R . Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93 Physics 169 electrons from the body flow to the earth and the body becomes neutral. The earth is so big that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all. Likewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change. The earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of a place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of a body, the potential of earth is taken as zero. Zero, Positive and Negative Potential: The potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is connected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. The potential of a positively charged body is positive and negatively charged body is negative. Unit of potential, Volt: If the work done in bringing 1 coulomb (1C) of positive charge from infinity to a point in the electric field is 1 joule (1J), then the potential at that point is called 1 volt (1V). The potential at a point in an electric field is 20V means to bring 1 coulomb (1C) positive charge from infinity to that point 20J work is to be done. Potential difference: Let, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are VA and VB respectively (fig: 10.14). The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to point A is VA and to point B is VB. Therefore the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from point B to point A is VA -VB i.e. the potential difference between these two points. Figure: 10.14 The work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in an electric field is called potential difference between two points. 10.8 Electric capacitor: The capability of storing energy as electric charge is called capacitor. Capacitor is the mechanical device designed to sustain the capacitance. Capacitor stores energy from a source such as electric cell and again uses it. A capacitor is made by placing an insulating material such as air, glass, plastic etc. Therefore, the mechanical Figure: 10.15 process of storing energy as electric charges by placing an insulating medium in between two nearby conductors is called capacitor. A simple capacitor is made by placing two insulating metal plates parallel to each other. When a battery is connected to its two plates (Fig:10.15) then electrons may flow to a plate from its negative rod and is charged negatively. Electrons flow to the positive rod of battery from the other plate of the capacitor. As a result that plate is charged positively. The amount of charge deposited in the plates depends on the voltage of the battery."

Physics amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table.

In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B.

Again if the specific heat of the material of a body is S, then S joule heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K. Therefore, to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat required = S joule \u2234 to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of heat required = mS joule It is the heat capacity of the body with a mass of m kg. \u2234Heat capacity, C = mS joule \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 or, Heat capacity = mass \u00d7 specific heat Heat Capacity \u2234 Specific heat = It is the relation between heat capacity and specific heat. 6.17 Fundamental principle of Calorimetry When two bodies of different temperatures are brought in thermal contact then reception and donation of heat take place.

        "context": "Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion.

Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands? = o) / ;| [ P Fig: 6.1 Water at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right hand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. Temperature Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position. The body with more temperature will Fig: 6.2 lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer.

Again if the specific heat of the material of a body is S, then S joule heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K. Therefore, to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat required = S joule \u2234 to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of heat required = mS joule It is the heat capacity of the body with a mass of m kg. \u2234Heat capacity, C = mS joule \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 or, Heat capacity = mass \u00d7 specific heat Heat Capacity \u2234 Specific heat = It is the relation between heat capacity and specific heat. 6.17 Fundamental principle of Calorimetry When two bodies of different temperatures are brought in thermal contact then reception and donation of heat take place. The body at higher temperature leaves heat whereas the body at lower temperature receives heat. This give and take will continue until they reach at the thermal equilibrium. If no heat is lost during donation and reception of heat, then the amount of heat given up by the body at higher temperature will be equal to the heat gained by the body at lower temperature. So, Heat lost = Heat gained \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 It is called the principle of Calorimetry.

The body with more temperature will Fig: 6.2 lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer. amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics"

        "context": "Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The temperature difference between the two fixed points is called the fundamental interval of a thermometer. The fundamental interval i.e. ` the space 5] I ] fiE \\in between the two fixed points is divided in different ways to prepare different scales of temperature. There are three scales of temperature in use \u2013 Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of these three scales are \u00b0C, \u00b0F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 32\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper fixed point in Celsius scale is 100\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 212\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K.

Ans: 5880Pa 5.7 Pressure of a fluid and buoyancy A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. R e R \u2014\u2014 I P R . Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93 Physics 169 electrons from the body flow to the earth and the body becomes neutral. The earth is so big that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all. Likewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change. The earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of a place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of a body, the potential of earth is taken as zero. Zero, Positive and Negative Potential: The potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is connected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. The potential of a positively charged body is positive and negatively charged body is negative. Unit of potential, Volt: If the work done in bringing 1 coulomb (1C) of positive charge from infinity to a point in the electric field is 1 joule (1J), then the potential at that point is called 1 volt (1V). The potential at a point in an electric field is 20V means to bring 1 coulomb (1C) positive charge from infinity to that point 20J work is to be done. Potential difference: Let, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are VA and VB respectively (fig: 10.14). The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to point A is VA and to point B is VB. Therefore the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from point B to point A is VA -VB i.e. the potential difference between these two points. Figure: 10.14 The work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in an electric field is called potential difference between two points. 10.8 Electric capacitor: The capability of storing energy as electric charge is called capacitor. Capacitor is the mechanical device designed to sustain the capacitance. Capacitor stores energy from a source such as electric cell and again uses it. A capacitor is made by placing an insulating material such as air, glass, plastic etc. Therefore, the mechanical Figure: 10.15 process of storing energy as electric charges by placing an insulating medium in between two nearby conductors is called capacitor. A simple capacitor is made by placing two insulating metal plates parallel to each other. When a battery is connected to its two plates (Fig:10.15) then electrons may flow to a plate from its negative rod and is charged negatively. Electrons flow to the positive rod of battery from the other plate of the capacitor. As a result that plate is charged positively. The amount of charge deposited in the plates depends on the voltage of the battery."

The body at higher temperature leaves heat whereas the body at lower temperature receives heat. This give and take will continue until they reach at the thermal equilibrium. If no heat is lost during donation and reception of heat, then the amount of heat given up by the body at higher temperature will be equal to the heat gained by the body at lower temperature. So, Heat lost = Heat gained \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 It is called the principle of Calorimetry.

Three more thermometers graduated in Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale are kept side by side. The readings of the point P of the thermometer AB in other three scales are C, F and K respectively. Therefore the readings of distance PA in these three scales are C-0, F-32 and K-273 respectively.

The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. The molecules of liquids and gases move at random in different directions. Kinetic energy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion forces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation of potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the molecules of a substance is called its internal energy. Evidently a part of the internal energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the kinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point.

Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point.

        "answer": "Thermal expansion is the change in volume or length of a substance due to a change in temperature. In solids, liquids, and gases, the expansion is due to the increased kinetic energy of the molecules, causing them to move further apart. The expansion of a substance is directly proportional to the change in temperature and the coefficient of thermal expansion.\n\nFor solids, the expansion is linear, meaning that the length, area, and volume increase in a straight line with temperature. The coefficient of linear expansion (\u03b1) is a measure of the change in length per unit change in temperature.\n\nFor liquids, the expansion is also linear, but the coefficient of linear expansion is typically higher than that of solids. For gases, the expansion is maximum due to the high kinetic energy of the molecules.\n\nThe thermal expansion of a substance can be described by the equation:\n\nV = V0(1 + \u03b1(\u03b8 - \u03b80))\n\nwhere V is the final volume, V0 is the initial volume, \u03b1 is the coefficient of thermal expansion, \u03b8 is the final temperature, and \u03b80 is the initial temperature.\n\nThe thermal expansion of a substance affects its physical properties, such as its volume, length, and pressure. It also affects the behavior of the substance in various applications, such as engineering, materials science, and physics.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to temperature changes. Solids expand linearly, liquids expand volumetrically, and gases expand the most due to the weak intermolecular forces between their molecules. The coefficient of thermal expansion varies depending on the material.",

But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation.

But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it.

Physics Physics 6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container \u2234Vr = Va + Vg \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.5) 6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature. B Fig: 6.8 A solid may be liquefied by applying heat. This process is called fusion. At the beginning the temperature of a body rises with the application of heat and at one stage the temperature does not change even if more heat is applied. At this moment the Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at \u03b81 temperature be l1 and at \u03b82 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 \u2013 l1 And increase of temperature = \u03b82 - \u03b81 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by \u03b1 and it can be expressed as, 2- \u03b1 = \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.2) l1(\u03b82 - \u03b81) Increase in length = Initial length x increase of temperature In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 1K, then -\u00ab | > u \u03b1 = l2 \u2013 l1 = increase in length.

        "answer": "Latent heat is the amount of heat required to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. In the case of fusion, the latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat required to change a solid into a liquid at its melting point.

Physics amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands? = o) / ;| [ P Fig: 6.1 Water at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right hand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. Temperature Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position. The body with more temperature will Fig: 6.2 lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer."

Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C.

        "context": "Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at \u03b81 temperature be l1 and at \u03b82 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 \u2013 l1 And increase of temperature = \u03b82 - \u03b81 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by \u03b1 and it can be expressed as, 2- \u03b1 = \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.2) l1(\u03b82 - \u03b81) Increase in length = Initial length x increase of temperature In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 1K, then -\u00ab | > u \u03b1 = l2 \u2013 l1 = increase in length.

The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. The molecules of liquids and gases move at random in different directions. Kinetic energy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion forces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation of potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the molecules of a substance is called its internal energy. Evidently a part of the internal energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the kinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water.

Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property.

Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The temperature difference between the two fixed points is called the fundamental interval of a thermometer. The fundamental interval i.e. ` the space 5] I ] fiE \\in between the two fixed points is divided in different ways to prepare different scales of temperature. There are three scales of temperature in use \u2013 Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of these three scales are \u00b0C, \u00b0F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 32\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper fixed point in Celsius scale is 100\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 212\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K.

Ans: 5880Pa 5.7 Pressure of a fluid and buoyancy A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. R e R \u2014\u2014 I P R . Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93 Physics 169 electrons from the body flow to the earth and the body becomes neutral. The earth is so big that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all. Likewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change. The earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of a place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of a body, the potential of earth is taken as zero. Zero, Positive and Negative Potential: The potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is connected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. The potential of a positively charged body is positive and negatively charged body is negative. Unit of potential, Volt: If the work done in bringing 1 coulomb (1C) of positive charge from infinity to a point in the electric field is 1 joule (1J), then the potential at that point is called 1 volt (1V). The potential at a point in an electric field is 20V means to bring 1 coulomb (1C) positive charge from infinity to that point 20J work is to be done. Potential difference: Let, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are VA and VB respectively (fig: 10.14). The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to point A is VA and to point B is VB. Therefore the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from point B to point A is VA -VB i.e. the potential difference between these two points. Figure: 10.14 The work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in an electric field is called potential difference between two points. 10.8 Electric capacitor: The capability of storing energy as electric charge is called capacitor. Capacitor is the mechanical device designed to sustain the capacitance. Capacitor stores energy from a source such as electric cell and again uses it. A capacitor is made by placing an insulating material such as air, glass, plastic etc. Therefore, the mechanical Figure: 10.15 process of storing energy as electric charges by placing an insulating medium in between two nearby conductors is called capacitor. A simple capacitor is made by placing two insulating metal plates parallel to each other. When a battery is connected to its two plates (Fig:10.15) then electrons may flow to a plate from its negative rod and is charged negatively. Electrons flow to the positive rod of battery from the other plate of the capacitor. As a result that plate is charged positively. The amount of charge deposited in the plates depends on the voltage of the battery."

Explain the influence of factors on vaporization. 16. Explain specific heat and heat capacity. 17. Explain the principle of measurement of heat. Physics amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at \u03b81 temperature be l1 and at \u03b82 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 \u2013 l1 And increase of temperature = \u03b82 - \u03b81 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by \u03b1 and it can be expressed as, 2- \u03b1 = \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.2) l1(\u03b82 - \u03b81) Increase in length = Initial length x increase of temperature In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 1K, then -\u00ab | > u \u03b1 = l2 \u2013 l1 = increase in length.

Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands? = o) / ;| [ P Fig: 6.1 Water at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right hand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. Temperature Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position. The body with more temperature will Fig: 6.2 lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer. Physics Matter Specific Heat (Jkg-1K-1) Ice 2100 Water Vapor 2000 Lead 130 Copper 400 Silver 230 6.16 Relation between specific heat and thermal capacity We know, the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a body through 1K is called its heat capacity. Again if the specific heat of the material of a body is S, then S joule heat is required to raise the temperature of the body through 1K. Therefore, to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat required = S joule \u2234 to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of heat required = mS joule It is the heat capacity of the body with a mass of m kg. \u2234Heat capacity, C = mS joule \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 or, Heat capacity = mass \u00d7 specific heat Heat Capacity \u2234 Specific heat = It is the relation between heat capacity and specific heat. 6.17 Fundamental principle of Calorimetry When two bodies of different temperatures are brought in thermal contact then reception and donation of heat take place. The body at higher temperature leaves heat whereas the body at lower temperature receives heat. This give and take will continue until they reach at the thermal equilibrium. If no heat is lost during donation and reception of heat, then the amount of heat given up by the body at higher temperature will be equal to the heat gained by the body at lower temperature. So, Heat lost = Heat gained \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 It is called the principle of Calorimetry.

The molecules of a solid vibrate about a fixed point. The molecules of liquids and gases move at random in different directions. Kinetic energy develops due to this motion of the molecules. Again attraction and repulsion forces are present among the molecules of a solid and this is the cause for the generation of potential energy. Among the gaseous molecules attraction-repulsion force does not exist and so there is no potential energy. The sum of the kinetic and potential energy of the molecules of a substance is called its internal energy. Evidently a part of the internal energy originates from kinetic energy and the other part from potential energy. If thermal energy is applied to a body then its internal energy will increase. But only the kinetic energy of the internal energy causes the raise of temperature of the body. Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately.

Physics Physics 6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container \u2234Vr = Va + Vg \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.5) 6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature. B Fig: 6.8 A solid may be liquefied by applying heat. This process is called fusion. At the beginning the temperature of a body rises with the application of heat and at one stage the temperature does not change even if more heat is applied. At this moment the Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at \u03b81 temperature be l1 and at \u03b82 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 \u2013 l1 And increase of temperature = \u03b82 - \u03b81 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by \u03b1 and it can be expressed as, 2- \u03b1 = \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.2) l1(\u03b82 - \u03b81) Increase in length = Initial length x increase of temperature In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 1K, then -\u00ab | > u \u03b1 = l2 \u2013 l1 = increase in length.

Explain the influence of factors on vaporization. 16. Explain specific heat and heat capacity. 17. Explain the principle of measurement of heat. Physics amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C.

Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B.

Temperature Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position.

Therefore, to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of 1kg the amount of heat required = S joule \u2234 to increase the temperature through 1K of a body with a mass of m kg the amount of heat required = mS joule It is the heat capacity of the body with a mass of m kg. \u2234Heat capacity, C = mS joule \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 or, Heat capacity = mass \u00d7 specific heat Heat Capacity \u2234 Specific heat = It is the relation between heat capacity and specific heat. 6.17 Fundamental principle of Calorimetry When two bodies of different temperatures are brought in thermal contact then reception and donation of heat take place.

Physics Physics 6.8 Real and apparent expansion of liquids Liquid always has to be heated keeping it in a container. The liquid as well as the container expand when heat is applied. So, the expansion of the liquid observed by us is not the real expansion but it is an apparent expansion. There are two types of expansions of liquids- a. Real expansion b. Apparent expansion Real expansion: If it had been possible to heat a liquid without keeping it in a vessel then the real expansion of the liquid that would be obtained is called real expansion of the liquid. But heating a liquid without a container is not possible. So, considering the expansion of the container the actual expansion of the liquid that is obtained is called the real expansion. It is expressed by Vr. Apparent expansion: The expansion of liquid apparently observed without considering the expansion of the container is called the apparent expansion of liquid. It is denoted by Va. Relation between real expansion and apparent expansion: A glass bulb with a long graduated stem is filled with liquid up to the mark A. Now keeping an eye on the liquid column the bulb is heated and it is observed that the upper level of the liquid comes down from position A to position B. After that it moves up from the graduated line B crossing the mark A and reaches to mark C. The reason is that when heat is applied the volume of the bulb increases at first. Due to this cause liquid comes down to B from A. Later on as soon as the liquid gets heated its volume starts to increase and reaches from B to C. It happens so as the expansion of liquid is more than the expansion of solid. Apparently it appears to us that the liquid was at mark A and finally reaches to mark C. Therefore, CA is the apparent expansion. CB is the real expansion and AB indicates the expansion of the container. From figure it is observed that, CB = CA+AB or, Real expansion = Apparent expansion + expansion of the container \u2234Vr = Va + Vg \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.5) 6.9 Effect of heat on change of state: Matter can exist in three states e.g. solid, liquid and gas. All of us know that water has three states-ice, water and vapor. These three states are called solid, liquid and gas. These states of water depend on air pressure and temperature. B Fig: 6.8 A solid may be liquefied by applying heat. This process is called fusion. At the beginning the temperature of a body rises with the application of heat and at one stage the temperature does not change even if more heat is applied. At this moment the Physics 6.5 Thermal Expansion of substance: Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least. 6.6 Expansion of solids: With the application of heat the length, area and volume of solid substance expands. Linear expansion of solid and coefficient of linear expansion: When heat is applied to a solid substance elongation of its length occurs towards a definite direction and the expansion along its length is called linear expansion. Let the length of a bar at \u03b81 temperature be l1 and at \u03b82 temperature the length be l2. Increase in length = l2 \u2013 l1 And increase of temperature = \u03b82 - \u03b81 The coefficient of linear expansion is denoted by \u03b1 and it can be expressed as, 2- \u03b1 = \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 (6.2) l1(\u03b82 - \u03b81) Increase in length = Initial length x increase of temperature In equation 6.2, if the initial length l1 = 1m and increase of temperature, \u03b82 - \u03b81 = 1K, then -\u00ab | > u \u03b1 = l2 \u2013 l1 = increase in length.

        "answer": "The triple point of water is the particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states - solid, liquid, and gas. The temperature of the triple point of water is 273.16 K, which is 273.16 degrees Celsius or 0.001 degrees Celsius above absolute zero. This temperature is significant because it is the only temperature at which water can exist in all three states simultaneously, making it a unique reference point for measuring temperature.",
        "referenceAnswer": "The triple point of water is the specific temperature and pressure at which water can coexist in all three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor). This unique condition is significant because it serves as a reference point for defining the Kelvin temperature scale, with the triple point of water being assigned a temperature of 273.16 K.",

The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as\\n\\n\\t1\\n273.16\\n\\nth part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K.",
        "context": "Unit of temperature: In SI system the unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). Kelvin: The particular temperature and pressure at which water remains at its three states- solid, liquid and gas, is called the triple point of water. The temperature of the triple point of water is considered as 273 K. 273.16 th part of the temperature of the triple point of water is called 1K. 6.2 Thermometric properties of matter: Special properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers. Thermometric properties of substances are \u2013 volume, resistance and pressure etc. In mercury thermometer the mercury in the capillary glass tube is called thermometric substance and the length of the mercury column is called thermometric property. Similarly in the case of gas thermometer the gas kept in the container at a constant volume is termed as thermometric substance and the pressure of the gas is called thermometric property. 6.3 Relation among Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale: A scale of temperature is essential to indicate the temperature of a body accurately. Two definite temperatures are taken as constant to prepare a temperature scale. These two temperatures are called fixed points. The two fixed points are lower fixed point and the upper fixed point. At standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure ice melts to water or pure water freezes to ice is called the lower fixed point. It is also termed as freezing point or ice point. Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point. The temperature difference between the two fixed points is called the fundamental interval of a thermometer. The fundamental interval i.e. ` the space 5] I ] fiE \\in between the two fixed points is divided in different ways to prepare different scales of temperature. There are three scales of temperature in use \u2013 Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin scale. The units of temperature of these three scales are \u00b0C, \u00b0F and K respectively. The lower fixed point in Celsius scale is 0\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 32\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 273K. The upper fixed point in Celsius scale is 100\u00b0C, in Fahrenheit scale 212\u00b0F and in Kelvin scale it is 373K.

Ans: 5880Pa 5.7 Pressure of a fluid and buoyancy A fluid is a substance which flows or is capable of flowing. Fluids are of two types - liquids and gases. Pressure of a fluid: The force exerted perpendicularly by a fluid at rest on unit area of a surface is called pressure. If the area of the surface is A and the force applied perpendicularly by the fluid is F, then pressure p = F/A. R e R \u2014\u2014 I P R . Buoyancy: A water filled pitcher is easy to move in water but it is not that much easy to move keeping it out of water. The pitcher is felt considerably lighter in immersed condition as upward thrust acts on it. Therefore, the thrust acting vertically upward is equal to the weight of equal volume of water displaced by the submersed body. For this reason an immersed body apparently losses its weight. Figur: 5.Magnitude of buoyancy: Every point of a body immersed in a fluid will experience thrust in all directions. Let a cylinder PQRS is of cross-sectional area A and height h. It is submersed in a fluid of density \u03c1. The depth of the upper and lower surface of the cylinder from the free surface of the fluid are h1 and h2 respectively. So, h = h2 \u2013 h1 The downward force acting on the surface PQ of the cylinder, F1 = Ah1\u03c1g The upward thrust exerted by the liquid on the surface SR of the cylinder, F2 = Ah2\u03c1g The lateral pressures experienced by the curved surface of the cylinder being equal and opposite of each other it become neutralized. \u2234 Upward thrust or buoyancy = F2 \u2013 F1 = Ah2\u03c1g \u2013 Ah1\u03c1g = A (h2 \u2013 h1) \u03c1g = Ah\u03c1g. = (hA)\u03c1g = V\u03c1g [ V = hA = volume of the cylinder] = weight of the displaced fluid by the cylinder. So, the upward thrust or buoyancy acting on a submersed body is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it. For this upward thrust it seems that a submersed body losses weight. 93 Physics 169 electrons from the body flow to the earth and the body becomes neutral. The earth is so big that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all. Likewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change. The earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of a place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of a body, the potential of earth is taken as zero. Zero, Positive and Negative Potential: The potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is connected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. The potential of a positively charged body is positive and negatively charged body is negative. Unit of potential, Volt: If the work done in bringing 1 coulomb (1C) of positive charge from infinity to a point in the electric field is 1 joule (1J), then the potential at that point is called 1 volt (1V). The potential at a point in an electric field is 20V means to bring 1 coulomb (1C) positive charge from infinity to that point 20J work is to be done. Potential difference: Let, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are VA and VB respectively (fig: 10.14). The work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to point A is VA and to point B is VB. Therefore the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from point B to point A is VA -VB i.e. the potential difference between these two points. Figure: 10.14 The work done in transferring a unit positive charge from one point to another point in an electric field is called potential difference between two points. 10.8 Electric capacitor: The capability of storing energy as electric charge is called capacitor. Capacitor is the mechanical device designed to sustain the capacitance. Capacitor stores energy from a source such as electric cell and again uses it. A capacitor is made by placing an insulating material such as air, glass, plastic etc. Therefore, the mechanical Figure: 10.15 process of storing energy as electric charges by placing an insulating medium in between two nearby conductors is called capacitor. A simple capacitor is made by placing two insulating metal plates parallel to each other. When a battery is connected to its two plates (Fig:10.15) then electrons may flow to a plate from its negative rod and is charged negatively. Electrons flow to the positive rod of battery from the other plate of the capacitor. As a result that plate is charged positively. The amount of charge deposited in the plates depends on the voltage of the battery."

        "answer": "Latent heat is the amount of heat required to change the state of a substance without changing its temperature. In the case of fusion, the latent heat of fusion is the amount of heat required to change a solid into a liquid at its melting point.

Explain the influence of factors on vaporization. 16. Explain specific heat and heat capacity. 17. Explain the principle of measurement of heat. Physics amount of heat absorbed by a body is used to convert the solid into liquid only. If heat is applied to ice below 0\u00b0C, temperature will rise and reach at 0\u00b0C. After this if more heat is applied the temperature will not rise but the ice will begin to melt to water. The amount of heat absorbed during the conversion of a solid to liquid is used to break the intermolecular bond of the molecules. On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable. 6.10 Fusion, Vaporization and Condensation: Fusion To transform a substance from solid to liquid by applying heat is called fusion. The definite temperature at which a solid starts to melt is called its melting point. This temperature remains unchanged until all of the substance melts. Vaporization The phenomenon of transformation of a liquid from its liquid state to gaseous state is called vaporization. This vaporization may occur in two processes- i) Evaporation ii) Boiling Evaporation The process in which a liquid at any temperature slowly changes from its free surface into vapor state is called evaporation. Activities: Take some water in a bowl and keep it at a corner of your room. Observe what happens to the water after one or two days. It will be observed that the water has been reduced. What is the cause for the reduction of this water? The water has been converted into vapor even at the room temperature and for this the amount of water has been lessened. This is called evaporation. Boiling The process in which a liquid is rapidly converted into vapor by increasing its temperature through application of heat is called boiling. The temperature at which boiling of liquid begins is called the boiling point of that liquid. The value of boiling point depends on pressure. Experiment: Pouring some water in a container and supplying heat the gradual increase of temperature would be observed. At a certain temperature the water will begin to boil and get converted into water vapor. It is called boiling. So, it is understood that liquid may be converted into its gaseous state at any temperature or at its boiling point. Condensation: The process of converting a gaseous substance from its gaseous state to liquid state by lowering the temperature is called condensation. Physics Physics 6.1 Heat and Temperature Heat: Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat. The molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases. Unit of Heat: In SI system the unit of heat is joule (J). Earlier the unit of heat used to be calorie (Cal). The relation between joule and calorie is 1Cal = 4.2 J. Task: Label three containers A, B, C kept on the table. Take water at room temperature in container A and take reasonably hot water (that your hand can tolerate) in container C. Mix some amount of hot water and water at room temperature in the container B. Now dip your right hand in the container A and left hand in the container C. After one minute bring out both hands and immerse both hands at the same time in the container B. What are the feelings of your two hands? = o) / ;| [ P Fig: 6.1 Water at a certain temperature is in the container B; yet hotness will be felt by the right hand and coldness by the left hand. Because the water in which the right hand was immersed previously was at a lower temperature than the water contained in B. Similarly coldness will be felt by the left hand because the water in which the left hand was immersed previously was at a higher temperature than the water contained in B. Temperature Temperature is such a thermal condition of a body which determines whether the body will receive or give up heat when it comes in thermal contact with another body. Temperature may be compared with the free surface of a liquid. We know that liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. In the figure the height of liquid in vessel A is more than that of the liquid in vessel B. But the amount of liquid in vessel A is less than the amount of liquid in vessel B. When stop cork S is opened the liquid from vessel A will start flowing to vessel B until the height of the liquid on both sides become equal. In the same way after the thermal contact, heat continues to flow from hotter body to colder one until the temperatures of the both bodies come to equilibrium position. The body with more temperature will Fig: 6.2 lose heat whereas the body having less temperature will gain heat. The name of the apparatus used to measure the temperature is called thermometer."

Since, the light rays can be centralized at a point using a concave mirror, the doctor use this mirror to examine eye, ear, nose and throat. Convex mirror 1. Since, a convex mirror always produce a virtual, erect and diminished image, it is used in cars to see the vehicles and passersby behind. In marriage ceremony it is used as view mirrors. 2. Since a wide range of area can be seen with the help of a convex mirror it is used in shopping mall or shop for security purpose. 3. It is used to prepare reflecting telescope. 4. It is used as reflector in the street lamps, since it spreads light over a large area. 8.8 Safe driving To drive vehicles like car, motor cycle etc. safely the driver should have an eye to many things. At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. For perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of him. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car. For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors just after he gets on the car. 8.9 Blinds turns on hilly roads To drive safely is an utmost duty for all drivers. Besides, it is more difficult to drive in bad weather like rainfall and fogs. Especially, driving in a hilly road is very risky. Since, hilly roads are zigzag as well as there are too ups and downs [Figure 8.23]. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to take turn by 90\u00b0 for driving in a hilly road. While taking a turn, the driver has to take enough precautions. In a blind turn, the drivers coming from opposite directions cannot see themselves, besides they are not at all aware of what remains on the other side. To solve this problem, large area mirrors are fitted at an angle of 45\u00b0 in the turn. As a result, the drivers can see everything around the turn and become able to drive safely. It is to be remembered that it is not appropriate to drive fast in the Physics PO ; [ o~ SN | R Figure: 8.13 In the figure an object AO and its image BI are shown. From the points O and A, perpendiculars are drawn on the mirror M1M2. They intersect the mirror at the points R and L. Now OR and AL are extended backward to the points I and B respectively, such that OR=IR and AL=BL. Two rays from each of the points O and A incident obliquely on the mirror and get reflected. When the two reflected rays are produced backward, they seem to be coming from the points I and B respectively. Now I and B are joined. Therefore, BI is the virtual image of the object AO formed in the plane mirror. The size of the image formed in a plane mirror is always equal to that of the object. The characteristics of the image formed in a plane mirror. The images formed by a plane mirror have the following properties: 1. The image in a plane mirror is at the same distance as the object is in front. 2. The size of the image is equal to the size of the object. 3. The image is virtual and erect. Images formed in a spherical mirror If an object is placed in front of a spherical mirror, that may be concave or convex, an image of the object is formed in the mirror. To know the position, size and nature of the image, we have to know the direction of the reflected beam of light emitted by an object. We can draw an image in a spherical mirror considering any two of the three rays described below. 1. Rays incident along the radius of curvature returns back along the same path after reflection in a spherical mirror [Figure: 8.14]. M Figure: 8.14 Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129"

Light is a kind of energy or external cause which enables us to see or creates the sense of vision in our eyes. In this chapter we will discuss about nature of light, mirrors, laws of reflection of light, types of mirror, how image is formed in a mirror, uses of mirror and magnification of images.] By the end of this chapter, we will be able to- 13.

Realize the influence of different optical phenomena and their contributions in our life and appreciate them. Physics 8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are: 1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. 2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 . 3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place. 4. Light is a form of energy. 5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave. 6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object Figure 8.1"

But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium.

First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane. 2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 7777777777777 M (0] - M Figure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds. 1.

Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l Figure 8.3: Regular reflection Figure 8.4: Diffused reflection Physics obtained [Fig: 9.7(b)] for which the refracted ray QR will pass along the separating surface AB, i.e. the angle of refraction will be \u2220 NQR1=90\u00b0. In this situation the angle of incidence in the denser medium ( \u2220 P1QN\u2032) is called the critical angle with respect to the rarer medium. In fig: 9.7(b) \u2220 P1QN\u2032 = \u03b8c = critical angle. The value of this critical angle also depends on the nature of the medium and the colour of light. Total Internal Reflection: If the angle of incidence in denser medium is increased further (i > \u03b8c), then the incident ray of light will be totally reflected in the denser medium. In this case no refracted ray can be observed. In this situation the separating surface of the two media behaves like a mirror. This phenomenon is called the total internal reflection. In fig: 9.7(c) the angle of incidence in denser medium \u2220 P2QN\u2032 is greater than the critical angle \u03b8c of the two media. For this reason the light ray P2Q incidents on separating surface AB and reflects along QR2 following the laws of reflection. Conditions for total internal reflection: i) The ray of light must incident from a denser medium at the surface of separation of a denser and a rarer medium. ii) The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle. 9.4 Mirage Sometimes thirsty traveler in desert sees the inverted image of a distant tree and thinks there is water. When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs. At that time the upside down image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage. /\u2018 Cold air Figure: 9.ZC Observation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer days you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery. It seems that there is water on the road. A similar phenomenon like mirage in a desert has happened here. 147"

Concave lens always forms image which is virtual, erect and smaller in size than the object. Identification of lens: When we hold a finger in front and very near of a lens and then look from the other side if a virtual, erect and magnified image of the finger is found to be formed, the lens is a convex one. But if the image is virtual, erect and diminished, the lens is a concave one. Do it yourself: Hold a convex lens close to your book. Do the writings seem larger? Why? After being refracted by convex lens, magnified image is formed and so you are seeing the writings larger. 9.8 Power of lens: Suppose there are two convex lenses.

In the case of second lens that focal point will not be as far as the first one, rather it will be nearer. The power of a convex lens is the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam. Therefore it can be said that the power of the first lens is less than that of the second one. The power of a lens is greater if its focal length is less and the power will be less if the focal length is greater. In figure: 9.19 the refraction of parallel rays in concave lens is shown. In the case of concave lens the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a divergent beam is called its power. The more the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more is its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power. In general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens. There is a relation between the power P and focal length f. That is, P = . The power of a lens of focal length one meter is called one diapter (d). The power of spectacle that the eye specialists recommend is written in diapter unit.

If the two rays are extended backward, they appear to come from the point I. So, point I is the virtual image of the point O. Normal IB is drawn on the principal axis from the point I. therefore, BI is the virtual and erect image of the object.

But a virtual image of an object is always formed in a convex mirror. The image is always erect and smaller in size than that of the object. In figure 8.19 MPM\u2032 is a convex mirror whose centre of curvature is C, principal focus is F and P is the pole. The object AO is placed perpendicular to the principal axis in front of the mirror.

Another ray OD incident perpendicularly through the centre of Figure: 8.19 curvature and reflects back along the same path. If these two diverging reflected rays are extended backward, they intersect at the point I and appear to be coming from the point I, therefore the point I is the virtual image of the point O.

It is to be remembered that it is not appropriate to drive fast in the Physics converging mirror since the parallel beam of light converges at a point or meets together after reflection from its surface. o~ ) -~\u2014\u2014\u2014- M - Figure: 8.Figure: 8.6 Convex mirror: If the convex surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the convex surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a convex mirror. In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5]. The convex mirror is a diverging mirror since the parallel beam of light diverges from a point or spreads over and never meets at a point after reflection [Figure 8.6]. Some definitions related to spherical mirrors Pole: The central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of the mirror. In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror, while it is the highest point in a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature.

Rays incident parallel to the principal axis after reflection in a convex mirror appear to diverge from the principal focus [Figure: 8.15]. A Figure: 8.B In a concave mirror, rays incident through the principal focus are reflected parallel to the principal axis. Rays directed towards the principal focus after reflection become parallel to the principal axis [Figure: 8.16]. P Figure: 8.16 Images formed in a concave mirror: The position, size and nature of an image formed in a spherical mirror depend on the position of the object placed in front of the mirror. If there is a change in the position of the object, then a corresponding change in the position, size and nature of the image also takes place. Let, MPM\u2032 be a concave mirror. Here, P is the pole, F is the principal focus and C is the centre of curvature of it. AO is the object situated perpendicularly on the principal axis in front of it. If the object is placed anywhere between infinity and the principal focus, the image thus formed will always be real and inverted. Again, in case of an object placed in between the principal focus and the pole, the image will be virtual and erect. The real and virtual images formed by a concave mirror are described below: Real image From the point O, a ray OM incident at the point M parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the principal focus along the path MI. Another ray OCM\u2032 from the point O incident through the centre of curvature C on the mirror and reflects back along the same path. After reflection, the two rays meet at the point I actually. Therefore I is the real image of the point O. From A, ray incident along the principal axis reflects back along the same path. So, the image of A will be formed on that line. Let us draw normal, IB, from the point I on the principal axis. Now, BI is the real image of the object AO [8.17]. The nature of the image is real and inverted. 135"

Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are: 1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. 2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 . 3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place. 4. Light is a form of energy. 5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave. 6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object Figure 8.1 Physics Chapter eight REFLECTION OF LIGHT = \u2014 [We see many things around us.

Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror.

Regular or uniform reflection 2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection.

When the two reflected rays are produced backward, they seem to be coming from the points I and B respectively. Now I and B are joined. Therefore, BI is the virtual image of the object AO formed in the plane mirror. The size of the image formed in a plane mirror is always equal to that of the object. The characteristics of the image formed in a plane mirror. The images formed by a plane mirror have the following properties: 1. The image in a plane mirror is at the same distance as the object is in front. 2. The size of the image is equal to the size of the object. 3. The image is virtual and erect. Images formed in a spherical mirror If an object is placed in front of a spherical mirror, that may be concave or convex, an image of the object is formed in the mirror.

It is not only in the case of mirrors, when you walk by the side of a pond or a river, your image appears in water that time also. This reflection is your image. When light is reflected in a mirror from your body or an object and comes to your eyes we see the image at that time. When light reflected from an object comes directly to our eyes, we see the object then. Again, if light does not enter our eyes directly rather it comes to our eyes being reflected or refracted in another medium, then also we see the object. Then it seems that the object is not in its actual position. When you see your image in a mirror, then it appears to you that you are behind the mirror. Actually you are in front of the mirror. The reflection of an object seen at the new position due to the presence of the mirror is called the image of that object. M\u2019 Figure 8.10"

Concave lens always forms image which is virtual, erect and smaller in size than the object. Identification of lens: When we hold a finger in front and very near of a lens and then look from the other side if a virtual, erect and magnified image of the finger is found to be formed, the lens is a convex one. But if the image is virtual, erect and diminished, the lens is a concave one. Do it yourself: Hold a convex lens close to your book. Do the writings seem larger? Why? After being refracted by convex lens, magnified image is formed and so you are seeing the writings larger. 9.8 Power of lens: Suppose there are two convex lenses.

In the case of second lens that focal point will not be as far as the first one, rather it will be nearer. The power of a convex lens is the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam. Therefore it can be said that the power of the first lens is less than that of the second one. The power of a lens is greater if its focal length is less and the power will be less if the focal length is greater. In figure: 9.19 the refraction of parallel rays in concave lens is shown. In the case of concave lens the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a divergent beam is called its power. The more the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more is its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power. In general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens. There is a relation between the power P and focal length f. That is, P = . The power of a lens of focal length one meter is called one diapter (d). The power of spectacle that the eye specialists recommend is written in diapter unit.

From the point O, a ray incident parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the principal focus. Another ray incident on the mirror through the centre of curvature reflects back along the same path. After reflection, two rays become mutually diverging. If the two rays are extended backward, they appear to come from the point I. So, point I is the virtual image of the point O. Normal IB is drawn on the principal axis from the point I. therefore, BI is the virtual and erect image of the object.

But a virtual image of an object is always formed in a convex mirror. The image is always erect and smaller in size than that of the object. In figure 8.19 MPM\u2032 is a convex mirror whose centre of curvature is C, principal focus is F and P is the pole. The object AO is placed perpendicular to the principal axis in front of the mirror. From the point O, the ray OM incident parallels to the principal axis of the mirror. After reflection the ray seems to diverge from the principal focus F of the mirror. Another ray OD incident perpendicularly through the centre of Figure: 8.19 curvature and reflects back along the same path. If these two diverging reflected rays are extended backward, they intersect at the point I and appear to be coming from the point I, therefore the point I is the virtual image of the point O. Now perpendicular IB is drawn on the principal axis from the point I. This BI is the virtual image of the object AO.

At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. For perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of him. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car. For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors just after he gets on the car. 8.9 Blinds turns on hilly roads To drive safely is an utmost duty for all drivers. Besides, it is more difficult to drive in bad weather like rainfall and fogs. Especially, driving in a hilly road is very risky. Since, hilly roads are zigzag as well as there are too ups and downs [Figure 8.23]. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to take turn by 90\u00b0 for driving in a hilly road. While taking a turn, the driver has to take enough precautions. In a blind turn, the drivers coming from opposite directions cannot see themselves, besides they are not at all aware of what remains on the other side. To solve this problem, large area mirrors are fitted at an angle of 45\u00b0 in the turn. As a result, the drivers can see everything around the turn and become able to drive safely. It is to be remembered that it is not appropriate to drive fast in the Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129 Physics image will also be displaced nearer to the mirror and the size of the image will increase gradually. But the image will always be smaller in size than that of the object. 8.6 Some common phenomena of formation of images in plane and spherical mirrors 1. Simple periscope: Periscope is used to see a distant object directly if there is an obstacle. A simple periscope is constructed using two plane mirrors. This instrument is formed utilizing successive reflection of light. In figure 8.20 a simple periscope is shown. Here, two plane mirrors are placed parallel to each other at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the axis of a long rectangular wood or metal tube. At first parallel light rays from the distant object incident on the mirror M1 at angle of 45\u00b0 with the normal to the mirror. The incident ray is reflected by the mirror M1 at an angle 45\u00b0 and incident on the mirror M2 travelling along the axis. The light ray is again reflected by the mirror M2 and enters the eyes horizontally. So, the object can be seen. Figure: 8.20 Thus by changing the direction of light we can see objects which cannot be seen directly using plane mirrors. Periscope is used to watch games in a crowd, to see something behind a wall, to observe the movement of the enemy soldiers etc. More developed types of periscope are used using prism in a submarine. 2. Plane mirror in a saloon: We see plane mirrors in a saloon or a parlor while cutting hair situated in front and behind. We can see the anterior protion of head in the front mirror. The image of the back portion of the head formed in the mirror behind. This image works as a virtual object for the front mirror and again forms image in the front mirror. Thus, we are able to see the back portion of the head in the front mirror. 3. Plane mirrors in medical field: The dentists use concave mirrors to examine the teeth. The mirror is placed very close to the teeth. As a result, a virtual and magnified image is formed in the mirror. Besides, the ENT doctors use concave mirrors for different purposes. 8.7 Uses of mirror We use different types of mirror for different purposes. These are described below: Plane mirror 1. We see our appearance by using plane mirrors. 2. The ophthalmologist uses plane mirrors to examine the vision of a patient for reading the alphabets easily. 3. Periscopes are constructed using plane mirrors. 4. It is used to avoid accidents in the turns of hilly road. 137"

        "answer": "Reflection of light is the change in direction of light rays when they hit a surface and bounce back.

The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and the incident and reflected rays lie in the same plane.",

How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds. 1. Regular or uniform reflection 2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l Figure 8.3: Regular reflection Figure 8.4: Diffused reflection Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection.

When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are: 1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. 2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium.

Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object Figure 8.1 Physics Chapter eight REFLECTION OF LIGHT = \u2014 [We see many things around us.

When the two reflected rays are produced backward, they seem to be coming from the points I and B respectively. Now I and B are joined.

Concave lens always forms image which is virtual, erect and smaller in size than the object. Identification of lens: When we hold a finger in front and very near of a lens and then look from the other side if a virtual, erect and magnified image of the finger is found to be formed, the lens is a convex one. But if the image is virtual, erect and diminished, the lens is a concave one. Do it yourself: Hold a convex lens close to your book. Do the writings seem larger? Why? After being refracted by convex lens, magnified image is formed and so you are seeing the writings larger. 9.8 Power of lens: Suppose there are two convex lenses. The focal length of the first one is greater and the focal length of the second one is smaller.

In the case of second lens that focal point will not be as far as the first one, rather it will be nearer. The power of a convex lens is the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam. Therefore it can be said that the power of the first lens is less than that of the second one. The power of a lens is greater if its focal length is less and the power will be less if the focal length is greater. In figure: 9.19 the refraction of parallel rays in concave lens is shown. In the case of concave lens the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a divergent beam is called its power. The more the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more is its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power. In general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens. There is a relation between the power P and focal length f. That is, P = . The power of a lens of focal length one meter is called one diapter (d). The power of spectacle that the eye specialists recommend is written in diapter unit.

From the point O, a ray incident parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the principal focus. Another ray incident on the mirror through the centre of curvature reflects back along the same path. After reflection, two rays become mutually diverging. If the two rays are extended backward, they appear to come from the point I. So, point I is the virtual image of the point O. Normal IB is drawn on the principal axis from the point I. therefore, BI is the virtual and erect image of the object. The position of the image so developed is behind the mirror, its nature is virtual and erect, and magnified i.e. larger than the size of the object. M A \u2122M Figure: 8.18 Images formed in a convex mirror: Depending on the position of the object in a concave mirror, real or virtual images are formed. But a virtual image of an object is always formed in a convex mirror. The image is always erect and smaller in size than that of the object. In figure 8.19 MPM\u2032 is a convex mirror whose centre of curvature is C, principal focus is F and P is the pole. The object AO is placed perpendicular to the principal axis in front of the mirror. From the point O, the ray OM incident parallels to the principal axis of the mirror. After reflection the ray seems to diverge from the principal focus F of the mirror. Another ray OD incident perpendicularly through the centre of Figure: 8.19 curvature and reflects back along the same path. If these two diverging reflected rays are extended backward, they intersect at the point I and appear to be coming from the point I, therefore the point I is the virtual image of the point O.

Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car.

We can draw an image in a spherical mirror considering any two of the three rays described below. 1. Rays incident along the radius of curvature returns back along the same path after reflection in a spherical mirror [Figure: 8.14]. M Figure: 8.14 Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129"

Periscope is used to watch games in a crowd, to see something behind a wall, to observe the movement of the enemy soldiers etc. More developed types of periscope are used using prism in a submarine. 2. Plane mirror in a saloon: We see plane mirrors in a saloon or a parlor while cutting hair situated in front and behind. We can see the anterior protion of head in the front mirror. The image of the back portion of the head formed in the mirror behind. This image works as a virtual object for the front mirror and again forms image in the front mirror. Thus, we are able to see the back portion of the head in the front mirror. 3. Plane mirrors in medical field: The dentists use concave mirrors to examine the teeth. The mirror is placed very close to the teeth. As a result, a virtual and magnified image is formed in the mirror. Besides, the ENT doctors use concave mirrors for different purposes. 8.7 Uses of mirror We use different types of mirror for different purposes. These are described below: Plane mirror 1. We see our appearance by using plane mirrors. 2. The ophthalmologist uses plane mirrors to examine the vision of a patient for reading the alphabets easily. 3. Periscopes are constructed using plane mirrors. 4. It is used to avoid accidents in the turns of hilly road. 137 Physics Ultra Sonography Ultra sonography is a procedure that depends on the reflection of sound of high frequency. When sound wave of high frequency is reflected from an organ or muscle within the body, then an image analogous to that organ is formed in the monitor by the reflected waves. The frequency of the ultrasound is 1-10 MHz which is used for diagnosis of diseases. In an ultra sonography machine, the high frequency ultrasonic waves are produced by electrically stimulating a crystal called a transducer. In an ultra sonography machine, the ultrasonic waves are transformed into a narrow beam. Next this beam is directed toward the organ whose image is to be recorded. )\u00ae - $= Figure: 14.3 Ultrasonography The beam is reflected, absorbed or transmitted by the organ toward which they are directed, depending on the nature of the surface they strike. As the beam strikes an interface or boundary between tissues of varying density (e.g., muscle and blood) part of the sound waves are reflected back to the transducer as echoes. The echoes are then converted into electrical impulses that are displayed on a monitor presenting a \u2018picture\u2019 of the organ or muscle under examination. Figure: 14.3 Ultrasonography The most important use of ultra sonography is in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. With this, the fetal size, maturity and normal and abnormal position of fetus can be known. It is a fast, relatively safe, and reliable technique in the field of gynecology. Uterine tumors and other pelvic masses can be identified by ultra sonography. Ultra sonogram is used in medical tests of different kinds, such as- gall bladder stone, defect in the heart and identification of tumors. When ultrasound is used for examination of the heart, then it is called echocardiography. Ultra sonography is a safer diagnosing method in comparison to X-ray. Yet, it is to be used for a very limited time. Besides, the transducer should always be kept in movement, so that it does not become static at any position. CT scan CT scan stands for Computed Tomography Scan. In medical science it is the process of creating image. Tomography is the process of generating a two-dimensional image of a slice or section through a 3-dimensional object. CT scanner is a large machine and uses X-rays. Where X-ray forms a two dimensional image of a three dimensional organ inside the body, there the image formed by CT scan machine is three dimensional. The CT scan machine uses digital geometry processing to generate a three dimensional of the inside of an object. The three dimensional image is made after many 2- Physics Slide Calipers : The other name of slide calipers is venire calipers. Because the Venire\u2019s method is used for the measurement with this instrument. The main scale of the slide calipers is made of a graduated rectangular still plate. A metal jaw is fixed at the starting end of the main scale, that is, at the end marked 0 of the main scale. A Jawed small scale is put over the body of the main scale, to measure fraction of the small division of the main scale accurately. It is called venire scale. \" Fig 1.2 Slide Calipers This Jawed vernier scale can be moved forward or backward along with the main scale. There is screw in it. It can be fixed at any point on the body of the main scale with this screw. When the Jaw of the vernier scale touches the Jaw of the main scale then the zero of the main scale should coincide with the zero of the vernier scale. By using vernier scale fraction of millimeter may be measured accurately. Vernier constant of the slide calipers can determine from the above mentioned vernier scale chapter. Measurement of slide calipers : Suppose, the length of rod is to be measured. The rod is to be placed between the two jaws of the slide calipers. The jaw connected with the vernier scale is to be pushed forward so that the jaws of the main scale and the vernier scale touch the opposite ends of the object. The rod is placed such that it\u2019s left end coincides with zero (0) mark of the main scale. The vernier scale is moved forward and backward to make it coincide with the right side of the rod. Suppose the right end of the rod has crossed M mm mark of the scale and is between M and (M + 1) mm. This extra distance beyond M mm is to be determined by using the vernier scale. This length will be the vernier reading. Now it is to be noted which vernier scale mark coincides with which of the main scale mark. If no vernier mark coincide with a main scale mark then find out the nearest vernier mark. The reading of this mark that is the number of vernier scale divisions from the left to this mark, is the vernier scale reading. Suppose the Vth vernier mark coincides with or nearest with any main scale mark. Hence the vernier constant of the instrument is VC."

Some definitions related to spherical mirrors Pole: The central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of the mirror. In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror, while it is the highest point in a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by r. AN P e Figure: 8.7 Principal axis: The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC is the principal axis. Secondary axis: The straight line passing through the centre of curvature and any point other than the pole on the reflecting surface of the sphere is called the secondary axis. In figure 8.7, P\u2032C is the secondary axis. Physics <3~ Figure: 8.Virtual image: In figure 8.18 the object is situated between the pole and the principal focus. From the point O, a ray incident parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the principal focus. Another ray incident on the mirror through the centre of curvature reflects back along the same path. After reflection, two rays become mutually diverging. If the two rays are extended backward, they appear to come from the point I. So, point I is the virtual image of the point O. Normal IB is drawn on the principal axis from the point I. therefore, BI is the virtual and erect image of the object. The position of the image so developed is behind the mirror, its nature is virtual and erect, and magnified i.e. larger than the size of the object. M A \u2122M Figure: 8.18 Images formed in a convex mirror: Depending on the position of the object in a concave mirror, real or virtual images are formed. But a virtual image of an object is always formed in a convex mirror. The image is always erect and smaller in size than that of the object. In figure 8.19 MPM\u2032 is a convex mirror whose centre of curvature is C, principal focus is F and P is the pole. The object AO is placed perpendicular to the principal axis in front of the mirror. From the point O, the ray OM incident parallels to the principal axis of the mirror. After reflection the ray seems to diverge from the principal focus F of the mirror. Another ray OD incident perpendicularly through the centre of Figure: 8.19 curvature and reflects back along the same path. If these two diverging reflected rays are extended backward, they intersect at the point I and appear to be coming from the point I, therefore the point I is the virtual image of the point O. Now perpendicular IB is drawn on the principal axis from the point I. This BI is the virtual image of the object AO.

        "context": "Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129 Physics In a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. Laws of reflection: The incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane. 2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 7777777777777 M (0] - M Figure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds. 1. Regular or uniform reflection 2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l Figure 8.3: Regular reflection Figure 8.4: Diffused reflection Physics obtained [Fig: 9.7(b)] for which the refracted ray QR will pass along the separating surface AB, i.e. the angle of refraction will be \u2220 NQR1=90\u00b0. In this situation the angle of incidence in the denser medium ( \u2220 P1QN\u2032) is called the critical angle with respect to the rarer medium. In fig: 9.7(b) \u2220 P1QN\u2032 = \u03b8c = critical angle. The value of this critical angle also depends on the nature of the medium and the colour of light. Total Internal Reflection: If the angle of incidence in denser medium is increased further (i > \u03b8c), then the incident ray of light will be totally reflected in the denser medium. In this case no refracted ray can be observed. In this situation the separating surface of the two media behaves like a mirror. This phenomenon is called the total internal reflection. In fig: 9.7(c) the angle of incidence in denser medium \u2220 P2QN\u2032 is greater than the critical angle \u03b8c of the two media. For this reason the light ray P2Q incidents on separating surface AB and reflects along QR2 following the laws of reflection. Conditions for total internal reflection: i) The ray of light must incident from a denser medium at the surface of separation of a denser and a rarer medium. ii) The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle. 9.4 Mirage Sometimes thirsty traveler in desert sees the inverted image of a distant tree and thinks there is water. When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs. At that time the upside down image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage. /\u2018 Cold air Figure: 9.ZC Observation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer days you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery. It seems that there is water on the road. A similar phenomenon like mirage in a desert has happened here. 147"

Using suitable size of the concave mirror, the magnified and erect image of the face is formed in a concave mirror. It helps in beautification and shaving. 2. The dentists use concave mirror. 3. Concave mirrors are used as reflectors. For example- the concave mirror is used in torch light, search light of launch and steamers to determine the path. 4. Using concave mirror, the light and heat energy, etc. is centralized to heat a body. Besides, it is used to collect Radar and TV signal. For instance- dish antenna, solar oven, telescope and Radar collector etc. 5. Since, the light rays can be centralized at a point using a concave mirror, the doctor use this mirror to examine eye, ear, nose and throat. Convex mirror 1. Since, a convex mirror always produce a virtual, erect and diminished image, it is used in cars to see the vehicles and passersby behind. In marriage ceremony it is used as view mirrors. 2. Since a wide range of area can be seen with the help of a convex mirror it is used in shopping mall or shop for security purpose. 3. It is used to prepare reflecting telescope. 4. It is used as reflector in the street lamps, since it spreads light over a large area. 8.8 Safe driving To drive vehicles like car, motor cycle etc. safely the driver should have an eye to many things. At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. For perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of him. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car. For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors just after he gets on the car. 8.9 Blinds turns on hilly roads To drive safely is an utmost duty for all drivers. Besides, it is more difficult to drive in bad weather like rainfall and fogs. Especially, driving in a hilly road is very risky. Since, hilly roads are zigzag as well as there are too ups and downs [Figure 8.23]. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to take turn by 90\u00b0 for driving in a hilly road. While taking a turn, the driver has to take enough precautions. In a blind turn, the drivers coming from opposite directions cannot see themselves, besides they are not at all aware of what remains on the other side. To solve this problem, large area mirrors are fitted at an angle of 45\u00b0 in the turn. As a result, the drivers can see everything around the turn and become able to drive safely. It is to be remembered that it is not appropriate to drive fast in the Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection.

Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129"

During shooting of drama, cinema etc. brightness of any place is increased by reflecting light by plane mirror. Concave mirror 1. Using suitable size of the concave mirror, the magnified and erect image of the face is formed in a concave mirror. It helps in beautification and shaving. 2. The dentists use concave mirror. 3. Concave mirrors are used as reflectors. For example- the concave mirror is used in torch light, search light of launch and steamers to determine the path. 4. Using concave mirror, the light and heat energy, etc. is centralized to heat a body. Besides, it is used to collect Radar and TV signal. For instance- dish antenna, solar oven, telescope and Radar collector etc. 5. Since, the light rays can be centralized at a point using a concave mirror, the doctor use this mirror to examine eye, ear, nose and throat. Convex mirror 1. Since, a convex mirror always produce a virtual, erect and diminished image, it is used in cars to see the vehicles and passersby behind. In marriage ceremony it is used as view mirrors. 2. Since a wide range of area can be seen with the help of a convex mirror it is used in shopping mall or shop for security purpose. 3. It is used to prepare reflecting telescope. 4. It is used as reflector in the street lamps, since it spreads light over a large area. 8.8 Safe driving To drive vehicles like car, motor cycle etc. safely the driver should have an eye to many things. At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. For perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of him. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car. For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors just after he gets on the car. 8.9 Blinds turns on hilly roads To drive safely is an utmost duty for all drivers. Besides, it is more difficult to drive in bad weather like rainfall and fogs. Especially, driving in a hilly road is very risky. Since, hilly roads are zigzag as well as there are too ups and downs [Figure 8.23]. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to take turn by 90\u00b0 for driving in a hilly road. While taking a turn, the driver has to take enough precautions. In a blind turn, the drivers coming from opposite directions cannot see themselves, besides they are not at all aware of what remains on the other side. To solve this problem, large area mirrors are fitted at an angle of 45\u00b0 in the turn. As a result, the drivers can see everything around the turn and become able to drive safely. It is to be remembered that it is not appropriate to drive fast in the Physics converging mirror since the parallel beam of light converges at a point or meets together after reflection from its surface. o~ ) -~\u2014\u2014\u2014- M - Figure: 8.Figure: 8.6 Convex mirror: If the convex surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the convex surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a convex mirror. In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5]. The convex mirror is a diverging mirror since the parallel beam of light diverges from a point or spreads over and never meets at a point after reflection [Figure 8.6]. Some definitions related to spherical mirrors Pole: The central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of the mirror. In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror, while it is the highest point in a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by r. AN P e Figure: 8.7 Principal axis: The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC is the principal axis. Secondary axis: The straight line passing through the centre of curvature and any point other than the pole on the reflecting surface of the sphere is called the secondary axis. In figure 8.7, P\u2032C is the secondary axis. Physics 2. Rays incident parallel to the principal axis are reflected through the principal focus in a concave mirror. Rays incident parallel to the principal axis after reflection in a convex mirror appear to diverge from the principal focus [Figure: 8.15]. A Figure: 8.B In a concave mirror, rays incident through the principal focus are reflected parallel to the principal axis. Rays directed towards the principal focus after reflection become parallel to the principal axis [Figure: 8.16]. P Figure: 8.16 Images formed in a concave mirror: The position, size and nature of an image formed in a spherical mirror depend on the position of the object placed in front of the mirror. If there is a change in the position of the object, then a corresponding change in the position, size and nature of the image also takes place. Let, MPM\u2032 be a concave mirror. Here, P is the pole, F is the principal focus and C is the centre of curvature of it. AO is the object situated perpendicularly on the principal axis in front of it. If the object is placed anywhere between infinity and the principal focus, the image thus formed will always be real and inverted. Again, in case of an object placed in between the principal focus and the pole, the image will be virtual and erect. The real and virtual images formed by a concave mirror are described below: Real image From the point O, a ray OM incident at the point M parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the principal focus along the path MI. Another ray OCM\u2032 from the point O incident through the centre of curvature C on the mirror and reflects back along the same path. After reflection, the two rays meet at the point I actually. Therefore I is the real image of the point O. From A, ray incident along the principal axis reflects back along the same path. So, the image of A will be formed on that line. Let us draw normal, IB, from the point I on the principal axis. Now, BI is the real image of the object AO [8.17]. The nature of the image is real and inverted. 135"

Simple periscope: Periscope is used to see a distant object directly if there is an obstacle. A simple periscope is constructed using two plane mirrors. This instrument is formed utilizing successive reflection of light. In figure 8.20 a simple periscope is shown. Here, two plane mirrors are placed parallel to each other at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the axis of a long rectangular wood or metal tube. At first parallel light rays from the distant object incident on the mirror M1 at angle of 45\u00b0 with the normal to the mirror. The incident ray is reflected by the mirror M1 at an angle 45\u00b0 and incident on the mirror M2 travelling along the axis. The light ray is again reflected by the mirror M2 and enters the eyes horizontally. So, the object can be seen. Figure: 8.20 Thus by changing the direction of light we can see objects which cannot be seen directly using plane mirrors. Periscope is used to watch games in a crowd, to see something behind a wall, to observe the movement of the enemy soldiers etc. More developed types of periscope are used using prism in a submarine. 2. Plane mirror in a saloon: We see plane mirrors in a saloon or a parlor while cutting hair situated in front and behind. We can see the anterior protion of head in the front mirror. The image of the back portion of the head formed in the mirror behind. This image works as a virtual object for the front mirror and again forms image in the front mirror. Thus, we are able to see the back portion of the head in the front mirror. 3. Plane mirrors in medical field: The dentists use concave mirrors to examine the teeth. The mirror is placed very close to the teeth. As a result, a virtual and magnified image is formed in the mirror. Besides, the ENT doctors use concave mirrors for different purposes. 8.7 Uses of mirror We use different types of mirror for different purposes. These are described below: Plane mirror 1. We see our appearance by using plane mirrors. 2. The ophthalmologist uses plane mirrors to examine the vision of a patient for reading the alphabets easily. 3. Periscopes are constructed using plane mirrors. 4. It is used to avoid accidents in the turns of hilly road. 137"

Physics 8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are: 1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. 2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 . 3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place. 4. Light is a form of energy. 5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave. 6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object Figure 8.1"

When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129 Physics In a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. Laws of reflection: The incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane. 2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 7777777777777 M (0] - M Figure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds. 1. Regular or uniform reflection 2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l Figure 8.3: Regular reflection Figure 8.4: Diffused reflection Physics 2.

Simple periscope: Periscope is used to see a distant object directly if there is an obstacle. A simple periscope is constructed using two plane mirrors. This instrument is formed utilizing successive reflection of light. In figure 8.20 a simple periscope is shown. Here, two plane mirrors are placed parallel to each other at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the axis of a long rectangular wood or metal tube. At first parallel light rays from the distant object incident on the mirror M1 at angle of 45\u00b0 with the normal to the mirror. The incident ray is reflected by the mirror M1 at an angle 45\u00b0 and incident on the mirror M2 travelling along the axis. The light ray is again reflected by the mirror M2 and enters the eyes horizontally. So, the object can be seen. Figure: 8.20 Thus by changing the direction of light we can see objects which cannot be seen directly using plane mirrors. Periscope is used to watch games in a crowd, to see something behind a wall, to observe the movement of the enemy soldiers etc. More developed types of periscope are used using prism in a submarine. 2. Plane mirror in a saloon: We see plane mirrors in a saloon or a parlor while cutting hair situated in front and behind. We can see the anterior protion of head in the front mirror. The image of the back portion of the head formed in the mirror behind. This image works as a virtual object for the front mirror and again forms image in the front mirror. Thus, we are able to see the back portion of the head in the front mirror. 3. Plane mirrors in medical field: The dentists use concave mirrors to examine the teeth. The mirror is placed very close to the teeth. As a result, a virtual and magnified image is formed in the mirror. Besides, the ENT doctors use concave mirrors for different purposes. 8.7 Uses of mirror We use different types of mirror for different purposes. These are described below: Plane mirror 1. We see our appearance by using plane mirrors. 2. The ophthalmologist uses plane mirrors to examine the vision of a patient for reading the alphabets easily. 3. Periscopes are constructed using plane mirrors. 4. It is used to avoid accidents in the turns of hilly road. 137"

Physics So, the physical quantities which are independent or neutral that is, they do not depend on other quantity, rather other quantities depend on them, are called fundamental quantities. Scientists have identified seven such quantities as fundamental quantities which are used in all branches of science for measurement. These are (1) length (2) mass (3) time (4) temperature (5) electric current (6) luminous intensity and (7) amount of substance. All other quantities may be derived from fundamental quantities that means, these are obtained from the product or quotient of one or more fundamental quantities. These are called derived quantities or compound quantities. So, the quantities depend on fundamental quantities or obtain from fundamental quantities are called derived quantities. Velocity, acceleration, force, work, heat, electric current etc. are derived quantities since these are obtain from fundamental quantities. For instance, force = mass x acceleration = mass \u00d7 velocity time [ acceleration = velocity time ] = mass \u00d7 distance time \u00d7 1 time [ velocity = distance time ] distance = mass \u00d7 time2 Hence, force is a derived quantity. 1.5 Units of measurements Measurement is related to most of our daily activities. Moreover, we need accurate measurement for various research works. The act of measuring something in our daily life is called measurement. In general, measurement means the act of determining the quantity of something. For example, the distance of the school from Rizu\u2019s home is 700 meters. Sohel has bought 5 Kilograms of rice from the shop. Rina takes 50 seconds to go to the school\u2019s office room. Here, 700 meters is the distance, 5 kilograms is the mass of rice and 50 seconds is the amount of time spent. We need two things to measure anything. One is number and another is unit. A standard is essential, comparing with which any measurement is done. These standard quantities are called the unit of measurement. Say, the length of a rod is 4 meters. Here, meter is a unit of length and 1 meter is a specific measurement. Therefore, length of the rod 4 meters means length of the rod is 4 times of this 1 meter\u2019s unit. There are different"

Images formed in a spherical mirror If an object is placed in front of a spherical mirror, that may be concave or convex, an image of the object is formed in the mirror. To know the position, size and nature of the image, we have to know the direction of the reflected beam of light emitted by an object. We can draw an image in a spherical mirror considering any two of the three rays described below. 1.

Demonstrate with the help of figure. Physics image will also be displaced nearer to the mirror and the size of the image will increase gradually. But the image will always be smaller in size than that of the object. 8.6 Some common phenomena of formation of images in plane and spherical mirrors 1. Simple periscope: Periscope is used to see a distant object directly if there is an obstacle. A simple periscope is constructed using two plane mirrors. This instrument is formed utilizing successive reflection of light. In figure 8.20 a simple periscope is shown. Here, two plane mirrors are placed parallel to each other at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the axis of a long rectangular wood or metal tube. At first parallel light rays from the distant object incident on the mirror M1 at angle of 45\u00b0 with the normal to the mirror. The incident ray is reflected by the mirror M1 at an angle 45\u00b0 and incident on the mirror M2 travelling along the axis. The light ray is again reflected by the mirror M2 and enters the eyes horizontally. So, the object can be seen. Figure: 8.20 Thus by changing the direction of light we can see objects which cannot be seen directly using plane mirrors. Periscope is used to watch games in a crowd, to see something behind a wall, to observe the movement of the enemy soldiers etc. More developed types of periscope are used using prism in a submarine. 2. Plane mirror in a saloon: We see plane mirrors in a saloon or a parlor while cutting hair situated in front and behind. We can see the anterior protion of head in the front mirror. The image of the back portion of the head formed in the mirror behind. This image works as a virtual object for the front mirror and again forms image in the front mirror. Thus, we are able to see the back portion of the head in the front mirror. 3. Plane mirrors in medical field: The dentists use concave mirrors to examine the teeth. The mirror is placed very close to the teeth. As a result, a virtual and magnified image is formed in the mirror. Besides, the ENT doctors use concave mirrors for different purposes. 8.7 Uses of mirror We use different types of mirror for different purposes. These are described below: Plane mirror 1. We see our appearance by using plane mirrors. 2. The ophthalmologist uses plane mirrors to examine the vision of a patient for reading the alphabets easily. 3.

In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5]. The convex mirror is a diverging mirror since the parallel beam of light diverges from a point or spreads over and never meets at a point after reflection [Figure 8.6]. Some definitions related to spherical mirrors Pole: The central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of the mirror. In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror, while it is the highest point in a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by r. AN P e Figure: 8.7 Principal axis: The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis of that mirror.

From the points O and A, perpendiculars are drawn on the mirror M1M2. They intersect the mirror at the points R and L. Now OR and AL are extended backward to the points I and B respectively, such that OR=IR and AL=BL. Two rays from each of the points O and A incident obliquely on the mirror and get reflected. When the two reflected rays are produced backward, they seem to be coming from the points I and B respectively. Now I and B are joined. Therefore, BI is the virtual image of the object AO formed in the plane mirror. The size of the image formed in a plane mirror is always equal to that of the object.

In figure 8.8 and 8.9, PF is the focal length. In a spherical mirror, the focal length is half of the radius of curvature. Therefore, r f = . Focal plane: The plane imagined that passes through the principal focus and perpendicular to the principal axis is called the focal plane. 8.4 Image When you look at a mirror, you see your image. It is not only in the case of mirrors, when you walk by the side of a pond or a river, your image appears in water that time also. This reflection is your image. When light is reflected in a mirror from your body or an object and comes to your eyes we see the image at that time. When light reflected from an object comes directly to our eyes, we see the object then. Again, if light does not enter our eyes directly rather it comes to our eyes being reflected or refracted in another medium, then also we see the object. Then it seems that the object is not in its actual position. When you see your image in a mirror, then it appears to you that you are behind the mirror. Actually you are in front of the mirror. The reflection of an object seen at the new position due to the presence of the mirror is called the image of that object. M\u2019 Figure 8.10"

It is used to avoid accidents in the turns of hilly road. 137 Physics Persistence of vision: If any object is placed before our eyes an image of the object is formed in our retina. As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second. This period is called the persistence of vision. Advantage of having two eyes: If we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye forms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the object better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. If we see an object by our two eyes the superimposition of two images will happen and we will be able to see the object clearly. 9.10 Function of an eye: We have known earlier that there is a convex lens just behind the pupil of the eye which is called eye lens. It is necessary to change the focal length of eye lens to see the distant as well as near objects. [ Q B Py Figure: 9.21 In figure 9.21 the eye lens is shown. In front of the eye i.e. in front of the lens PQ is an object. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO coming from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real and inverted image of PQ. Where the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or nerve-fibers called rods and cones. When image or light falls on retina a kind of stimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object. It is mentionable that the inverted image of an object is formed on retina. This sensation is transmitted to the brain by the eye nerves. The brain then and there inverts the inverted image formed in the retina and we can see the object in its right shape and size. 9.11 Defects of vision and its remedy The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are: Investigation: 9.Image formation by a convex lens and its demonstration. Objective: Use of convex lens and production of real image in the lab.

To make the image clear move the lens forward or backward from the paper. 6. You will see the clear image of the object on the paper at definite distance. 7. In this way the image of a distant object can be projected on the wall. 8. Describe the form of the image.

        "context": "Physics 8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are: 1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium. 2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 . 3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place. 4. Light is a form of energy. 5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave. 6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects.

Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object Figure 8.1 Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made.

        "question": "Explain the concept of reflection of light. How does it differ from refraction?",
        "answer": "Reflection of light is the change in direction of light rays when they hit a surface and bounce back. This phenomenon occurs when light travels from one medium to another with a different optical density. In a homogenous transparent medium, light travels in a straight line with the same velocity. However, when light hits the surface of a second medium, some of the light is reflected back into the first medium, while the rest passes into the second medium.",
        "referenceAnswer": "In a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.",

But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light. Laws of reflection: The incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane. 2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. 7777777777777 M (0] - M Figure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds. 1. Regular or uniform reflection 2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l Figure 8.3: Regular reflection Figure 8.4: Diffused reflection Physics Chapter eight REFLECTION OF LIGHT = \u2014 [We see many things around us.

Realize the influence of different optical phenomena and their contributions in our life and appreciate them. Physics Diffused reflection If a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror. Mirrors are mainly of two types. Namely- 1. Plane mirror 2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror. Spherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are: 1. Concave mirror 2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a 129"

        "context": "Physics 5. Optical instruments like telescope, overhead projector, and laser are made using plane mirrors. 6. During shooting of drama, cinema etc. brightness of any place is increased by reflecting light by plane mirror. Concave mirror 1. Using suitable size of the concave mirror, the magnified and erect image of the face is formed in a concave mirror. It helps in beautification and shaving. 2. The dentists use concave mirror. 3. Concave mirrors are used as reflectors. For example- the concave mirror is used in torch light, search light of launch and steamers to determine the path. 4. Using concave mirror, the light and heat energy, etc. is centralized to heat a body. Besides, it is used to collect Radar and TV signal. For instance- dish antenna, solar oven, telescope and Radar collector etc. 5. Since, the light rays can be centralized at a point using a concave mirror, the doctor use this mirror to examine eye, ear, nose and throat. Convex mirror 1. Since, a convex mirror always produce a virtual, erect and diminished image, it is used in cars to see the vehicles and passersby behind. In marriage ceremony it is used as view mirrors. 2. Since a wide range of area can be seen with the help of a convex mirror it is used in shopping mall or shop for security purpose. 3. It is used to prepare reflecting telescope. 4. It is used as reflector in the street lamps, since it spreads light over a large area. 8.8 Safe driving To drive vehicles like car, motor cycle etc. safely the driver should have an eye to many things. At the very first, he has to check all the lamps in the car by switching them on. For perfect and safe driving, the drivers need not only to see what remains in front of him. Instead, he has to be careful about what remains behind the car. The mirrors are very important and indispensible parts of a car. For this, he has to adjust all the mirrors just after he gets on the car. 8.9 Blinds turns on hilly roads To drive safely is an utmost duty for all drivers. Besides, it is more difficult to drive in bad weather like rainfall and fogs. Especially, driving in a hilly road is very risky. Since, hilly roads are zigzag as well as there are too ups and downs [Figure 8.23]. Sometimes, it becomes necessary to take turn by 90\u00b0 for driving in a hilly road. While taking a turn, the driver has to take enough precautions. In a blind turn, the drivers coming from opposite directions cannot see themselves, besides they are not at all aware of what remains on the other side. To solve this problem, large area mirrors are fitted at an angle of 45\u00b0 in the turn. As a result, the drivers can see everything around the turn and become able to drive safely. It is to be remembered that it is not appropriate to drive fast in the Physics converging mirror since the parallel beam of light converges at a point or meets together after reflection from its surface. o~ ) -~\u2014\u2014\u2014- M - Figure: 8.Figure: 8.6 Convex mirror: If the convex surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the convex surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a convex mirror. In this case, convex mirror is made by silvering on the concave or inner surface of the part of the sphere [Figure 8.5]. The convex mirror is a diverging mirror since the parallel beam of light diverges from a point or spreads over and never meets at a point after reflection [Figure 8.6]. Some definitions related to spherical mirrors Pole: The central point of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is called the pole of the mirror. In figure 8.7, P is the pole of the mirror. Pole is the lowest point of the reflecting surface in case of a concave mirror, while it is the highest point in a convex mirror. Center of curvature: The centre of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, C is the centre of curvature. Radius of curvature: The radius of the sphere of which the spherical mirror is a part is called the radius of curvature of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC or MC is the radius of curvature. Radius of curvature is denoted by r. AN P e Figure: 8.7 Principal axis: The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror is called the principal axis of that mirror. In figure 8.7, PC is the principal axis. Secondary axis: The straight line passing through the centre of curvature and any point other than the pole on the reflecting surface of the sphere is called the secondary axis. In figure 8.7, P\u2032C is the secondary axis. Physics 2. Rays incident parallel to the principal axis are reflected through the principal focus in a concave mirror. Rays incident parallel to the principal axis after reflection in a convex mirror appear to diverge from the principal focus [Figure: 8.15]. A Figure: 8.B In a concave mirror, rays incident through the principal focus are reflected parallel to the principal axis. Rays directed towards the principal focus after reflection become parallel to the principal axis [Figure: 8.16]. P Figure: 8.16 Images formed in a concave mirror: The position, size and nature of an image formed in a spherical mirror depend on the position of the object placed in front of the mirror. If there is a change in the position of the object, then a corresponding change in the position, size and nature of the image also takes place. Let, MPM\u2032 be a concave mirror. Here, P is the pole, F is the principal focus and C is the centre of curvature of it. AO is the object situated perpendicularly on the principal axis in front of it. If the object is placed anywhere between infinity and the principal focus, the image thus formed will always be real and inverted. Again, in case of an object placed in between the principal focus and the pole, the image will be virtual and erect. The real and virtual images formed by a concave mirror are described below: Real image From the point O, a ray OM incident at the point M parallel to the principal axis and reflected through the principal focus along the path MI. Another ray OCM\u2032 from the point O incident through the centre of curvature C on the mirror and reflects back along the same path. After reflection, the two rays meet at the point I actually. Therefore I is the real image of the point O. From A, ray incident along the principal axis reflects back along the same path. So, the image of A will be formed on that line. Let us draw normal, IB, from the point I on the principal axis. Now, BI is the real image of the object AO [8.17]. The nature of the image is real and inverted. 135"
