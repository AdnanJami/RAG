The power of a lens is measured in diopters (D). The relationship between power (P) and focal length (f) is given by the formula: P = 1/f. This means that a lens with a focal length of 1 meter has a power of 1 diopter.",

In the case of second lens that focal point will not be as far as the first one, rather it will be nearer.

        "referenceAnswer": "Accommodation is the ability of the human eye to adjust its focus to see objects at different distances. This is achieved by the ciliary muscles, which control the shape of the eye lens. When we look at a distant object, the ciliary muscles relax, making the eye lens thinner and reducing its curvature. This increases the focal length, allowing the image of the distant object to be focused on the retina. Conversely, when we look at a nearby object, the ciliary muscles contract, making the eye lens thicker and increasing its curvature. This shortens the focal length, focusing the image of the near object on the retina.",
        "referenceContext": "The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye."

It occurs when the eyeball is too long or the eye lens is too curved, causing light to focus in front of the retina instead of on it. Myopia is corrected by using concave lenses (diverging lenses) in spectacles, which diverge incoming light rays, causing them to focus on the retina.\\nHypermetropia (long-sightedness) is a condition where a person can see distant objects clearly but has difficulty seeing near objects. It occurs when the eyeball is too short or the eye lens is too flat, causing light to focus behind the retina instead of on it. Hypermetropia is corrected by using convex lenses (converging lenses) in spectacles, which converge incoming light rays, causing them to focus on the retina.",
        "referenceContext": "The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:\\n\\n1. Short sight or Myopia\\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia\\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.\\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ]\\nEffects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen\\ndistinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at\\tFigure: 9.22\\ninfinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ]\\nRemedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.\\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye.\\n2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant objects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly.\\nEffect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed\\nnearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].\\n\\nFigure: 9.23\\n\\nRemedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles.\\nWe also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye.

        "referenceContext": "The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:\\n\\n1. Short sight or Myopia\\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia\\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.\\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ]\\nEffects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen\\ndistinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at\\tFigure: 9.22\\ninfinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ]\\nRemedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.\\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye.\\n2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant objects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly.\\nEffect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed\\nnearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].\\n\\nFigure: 9.23\\n\\nRemedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles.\\nWe also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye.

A virtual image, on the other hand, is formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point after passing through a lens.

Another ray PO from P passes through the optical centre O` and refracts straight along PON. These two refracted rays are divergent so they do not meet. If they are extended in the backward direction then it appears that they are coming from the point P1. Now if we draw a perpendicular P1Q1 on the principal axis from P1 then P1Q1 will be the virtual image of PQ. This image is virtual, erect and smaller than the object in size.

        "referenceAnswer": "The power of a lens is its ability to converge or diverge light rays. A lens with a shorter focal length has a greater power, meaning it can bend light more strongly. The power of a lens is measured in diopters (D). The relationship between power (P) and focal length (f) is given by the formula: P = 1/f. This means that a lens with a focal length of 1 meter has a power of 1 diopter.",
        "referenceContext": "Now if a beam of parallel rays of light parallel to the principal axis incidents on the lens then after refraction the rays will meet at the principal focus. In the case of second lens that focal point will not be as far as the first one, rather it will be nearer. The power of a convex lens is the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam. Therefore it can be said that the power of the first lens is less than that of the second one. The power of a lens is greater if its focal length is less and the power will be less if the focal length is greater.\\nIn figure: 9.19 the refraction of parallel rays in concave lens is shown. In the case of concave lens the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a divergent beam is called its power. The more the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more is its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power.\\nIn general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens.\\n1\\nThere is a relation between the power P and focal length f.

        "question": "Describe the process of accommodation in the human eye and its importance for vision.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Accommodation is the ability of the human eye to adjust its focus to see objects at different distances. This is achieved by the ciliary muscles, which control the shape of the eye lens. When we look at a distant object, the ciliary muscles relax, making the eye lens thinner and reducing its curvature. This increases the focal length, allowing the image of the distant object to be focused on the retina. Conversely, when we look at a nearby object, the ciliary muscles contract, making the eye lens thicker and increasing its curvature. This shortens the focal length, focusing the image of the near object on the retina. This process of accommodation is essential for clear vision at various distances.",
        "referenceContext": "The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye."

        "referenceAnswer": "Optical fibers utilize the principle of total internal reflection to transmit information signals as light pulses. They are thin strands of glass or plastic with a core having a higher refractive index than the surrounding cladding. When light enters the fiber at a small angle, it bounces off the cladding repeatedly due to total internal reflection, allowing it to travel long distances with minimal loss of energy. This makes optical fibers ideal for high-speed, long-distance communication, enabling the transmission of large amounts of data over vast distances with minimal signal degradation.",
        "referenceContext": "Optical fiber is made of very long thin flexible but solid glass or plastic fiber. The refractive index of the material of fiber is 1.7. A layer is made on this fiber by a material of comparatively less refractive index (1.5). When light ray that incidents at a small angle enters through one end of the fiber, then successive total internal reflections of light take place on the wall of the fiber and finally it emerges through the other end.\\nLight can be sent through the fiber almost without any loss of energy even if it is bent or coiled. A set of optical fiber is called optical tube.\\nUses of optical fiber in the field of health and telecommunication:\\nAn optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner wall of the stomach of any patient. A set of optical fiber of this optical tube is sent to lighten the stomach and the other set helps to see the lightened portion of stomach from the outside. This process is known as endoscopy. In this way by sending optical tube the block inside the artery, vein and function of valves of heart can be observed. Optical fiber is used for sending or receiving electrical signals from one place to another. Before sending, the electrical signal has to be converted into optical signal.\\nNear about 2000 telephone signals can be transmitted at a time through a single optical fiber. Almost no change takes place to the intensity of the signals for this kind of transmission. The use of optical fiber at present has brought about a significant change in communication system."

        "referenceAnswer": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one transparent medium to another. This bending occurs because the speed of light changes when it moves from one medium to another.  When light travels from a rarer medium (like air) to a denser medium (like glass), it slows down and bends towards the normal. Conversely, when light travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it speeds up and bends away from the normal.",
        "referenceContext": "Coming from air medium following the path AB, light ray incidents at point B of the separation surface PQ of two media. If the light ray goes straight it will follow the path BC' but it changes its path and follows BC. This phenomenon of bending of ray of light is called refraction. Therefore, when the ray of light travels obliquely from one transparent medium to another, the bending of ray of light at the surface of separation of the two media is called the refraction of light."

It quantifies how much light bends when going from one medium to another.",

It is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the medium. A higher refractive index means the light travels slower in that medium and bends more significantly. The refractive index is directly related to the velocity of light in a medium - the higher the refractive index, the slower the speed of light.",
        "referenceContext": "For a particular pair of transparent medium and a particular colour of light when ray of light refracts from one medium to another, then if the angle of incidence is i and the angle of refraction is r, then sin i / sin r will be a constant and it is called refractive index of the second medium with respect to the first medium for that colour of light.

        "referenceAnswer": "Total internal reflection occurs when a light ray travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium (e.g., from water to air) and the angle of incidence is greater than a certain angle called the critical angle. Instead of refracting out of the denser medium, the light is completely reflected back into it. This phenomenon is like a mirror effect at the boundary between the two media.\\nThe two necessary conditions for total internal reflection are:\\n1. **The light ray must be traveling from a denser medium to a rarer medium.**\\n2. **The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle.** This critical angle depends on the specific pair of media involved.\\nTotal internal reflection is used in optical fibers. The core of an optical fiber has a higher refractive index than the cladding surrounding it.  Light entering the fiber at a small angle undergoes total internal reflection at the core-cladding boundary, allowing it to travel long distances with minimal loss of energy.",
        "referenceContext": "If the angle of incidence in denser medium is increased further (i > ?c), then the incident ray of light will be totally reflected in the denser medium. In this case no refracted ray can be observed. In this situation the separating surface of the two media behaves like a mirror. This phenomenon is called the total internal reflection.\\nIn fig: 9.7(c) the angle of incidence in denser medium ? P2QN? is greater than the critical angle ?c of the two media. For this reason the light ray P2Q incidents on separating surface AB and reflects along QR2 following the laws of reflection.\\nConditions for total internal reflection:\\ni) The ray of light must incident from a denser medium at the surface of separation of a denser and a rarer medium.\\nii) The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle.\\n9.5 Optical Fiber\\nOptical fiber is made of very long thin flexible but solid glass or plastic fiber.

The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points.

        "referenceAnswer": "Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\\n1. Damaged insulation\\n2. Overheating of the cables\\n3. Damped conditions\\n1. Damaged insulation:\\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.\\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.\\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual\\nlarge current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.\\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of\\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky.\\nSafe use of electricity\\nFigure: 11.14\\nIn the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. In the present section, we will learn about the safe uses of electricity.\\nWhen using electricity at home, the safety measures that are needed:\\n1. Circuit breaker\\n2. Fuses\\n3. Correct connection of switch\\n4. Earth wire\\n1. Circuit breaker\\nCircuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of a house. Circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply in a circuit when there is an overflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of the house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire.\\n2. Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent excessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the electric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit is disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher current than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If the fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.\\n3. Correct connection of switch: A switch breaks or completes an electrical circuit. During switch connection in a circuit, an important precaution is that the switch must be fitted onto the live wire. For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source from the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be 'live' even if the switch is 'off' [Figure 11.16] and increase the risk of electric shock.\\nFigure 11.15 and 11.16\\n4. Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a complete circuit. These are the live (L) and neutral (N) wire. The live wire delivers the electrical energy to the appliance. On the contrary, the current returns back to the supply through the neutral wire and complete the circuit. The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18.",

For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source from the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be 'live' even if the switch is 'off' [Figure 11.16] and increase the risk of electric shock.\\nFigure 11.15 and 11.16\\n4. Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a complete circuit. These are the live (L) and neutral (N) wire. The live wire delivers the electrical energy to the appliance. On the contrary, the current returns back to the supply through the neutral wire and complete the circuit. The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18."

When electric current flows through this coil, it generates a magnetic field that is concentrated within the coil, resembling the magnetic field of a bar magnet.  The strength of the magnetic field can be increased by increasing the current flow or the number of turns in the coil.",

The magnetic field will be look alike the magnetic field of bar magnet. This type of coil is called Solenoid. If we insert any iron rod through it, the iron rod will be turned into magnet. If we stop the current, it will not remain magnet. If the direction of current is changed, the pole of magnet will be changed.

        "referenceAnswer": "We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave.\\nThere is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, alternating electric current is induced in the moving coil. Thus microphone converts the sound energy into electrical energy. This is called audio signal.",

The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison's effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconi's Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode.\\nAfter two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, there was another electrode known as grid in it. Grid controls the flow of electric current from anode to cathode. It is wonderful that the triode can work as an amplifier.

The expense of power for it is more, it is less reliable and cooling system is necessary to keep it cool. So the scientists were searching for a semiconductor device as its alternative.

        "question": "What are semiconductors and how are they used in integrated circuits?",
        "referenceAnswer": "There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material.\\nIf an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct\\ncurrent (DC).

        "referenceContext": "Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material.\\nIf an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct\\ncurrent (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol\\nIt is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons.

The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison's effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current.

His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research.

But this doesn't happen in case of any machine. Sometimes functions of the whole body stops due to infirmity of only one part of the body. For example- when function of the heart stops, functions of all other parts of the body stops too, and functions of the brain also stops very quickly."

Instead of taking commercial benefit from this invention, he opened it for all, so that others can develop this research more.\\nSubsequently, Jagadish Chandra Bose made a number of important and pioneering discoveries in plant physiology. Among these, invention of crescograph to record the growth of plants, extremely slight movement and how plants respond to various stimuli are notable.\\nHis major contribution in the field of bio-physics is the nature of conduction of the stimuli in plants. Earlier it was thought that, the nature of response of plants to different stimuli is chemical, but he became able to show that it is electric in nature."

        "question": "How can the human body be compared to a machine, and what are some of the limitations of this comparison?",
        "referenceAnswer": "We use different types of devices to meet our various needs of everyday life such as- automobiles, refrigerator, television, steam engine, internal combustion engine etc. Many people designated human body as a machine. Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs.\\nEach organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines.\\nHeart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active.\\nHuman body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into\\n\\nmechanical and heat energy by food ingestion and respiration. Therefore, human body is like an organic machine in fact. But, in many aspects, human body is more amazing than the most complex machine made by humans. Human body can perform such functions which is not possible for any machine. For instance- human body develops from only one cell. With the passage of time, this single cell transforms into a complete human body, which is build with thousand billions of cells. But this doesn't happen in case of any machine. Sometimes functions of the whole body stops due to infirmity of only one part of the body. For example- when function of the heart stops, functions of all other parts of the body stops too, and functions of the brain also stops very quickly.",
