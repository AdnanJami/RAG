        "referenceAnswer": "Pressure is defined as the force exerted perpendicularly on a unit area of a body. It can be calculated using the formula: Pressure = Force / Area. This means that pressure is directly proportional to the force applied and inversely proportional to the area over which the force is distributed.  Therefore, a smaller area will result in higher pressure for the same force, while a larger area will result in lower pressure.",

Density plays a crucial role in determining whether an object will float or sink in a fluid. An object denser than the fluid it's submerged in will sink because the weight of the object exceeds the buoyant force acting on it. Conversely, an object less dense than the fluid will float because the buoyant force is greater than the object's weight.",

Again at standard pressure and at the temperature at which pure boiling water converts into water vapor is called upper fixed point. The upper fixed point is also called boiling point or steam point.

The coefficient of thermal expansion varies depending on the material.",

When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it.

Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation.

The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object.\\nThe major properties of light are:\\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c ? 3?108 ms-1.\\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\\n4. Light is a form of energy.\\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents."

        "question": "What is a mirror, and how does it work to create an image?",
        "referenceAnswer": "A mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light.\\nA mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.",

        "referenceAnswer": "Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.\\nSpherical mirror\\nIf the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made.

        "question": "What is the difference between a luminous object and a non-luminous object? Give examples of each.",
        "referenceAnswer": "The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects.",
        "referenceContext": "We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat."
