        "answer": "Refraction of light is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different optical density. This occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media, causing the light to change direction. When light enters a denser medium, it bends towards the normal, and when it enters a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refraction of light is the bending of light as it passes from one transparent medium to another. This occurs because the speed of light varies in different media.",

            "Physics\n\n127\n\n8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are:\n\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\n\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 .\n\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\n\n4. Light is a form of energy.\n\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\n\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object\n\nFigure 8.1",

When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs. At that time the upside down image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage. /\u2018\n\nCold air\n\nFigure: 9.8\n\nZC\n\nObservation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer days you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery.

            "Physics\n\nDiffused reflection\n\nIf a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror\n\nA mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.\n\nMirrors are mainly of two types. Namely-\n\n1. Plane mirror\n\n2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.\n\nSpherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are:\n\n1. Concave mirror\n\n2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a\n\n129",
            "128\n\nPhysics\n\nIn a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.\n\nLaws of reflection:\n\nThe incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane.\n\n2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\n7777777777777 M (0] - M\n\nFigure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.\n\n1. Regular or uniform reflection\n\n2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l\n\nFigure 8.3: Regular reflection\n\nFigure 8.4: Diffused reflection"

        "answer": "Refraction of light is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another with a different optical density. This occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media, causing the light to change direction. When light enters a denser medium from a rarer medium, it bends towards the normal, and when it enters a rarer medium from a denser medium, it bends away from the normal.",

When light travels from a rarer medium (like air) to a denser medium (like glass), it slows down and bends towards the normal.

            "Physics\n\n127\n\n8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are:\n\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\n\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 .\n\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\n\n4. Light is a form of energy.\n\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\n\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object\n\nFigure 8.1",

When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal.

            "Physics\n\nDiffused reflection\n\nIf a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror\n\nA mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.\n\nMirrors are mainly of two types. Namely-\n\n1. Plane mirror\n\n2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.\n\nSpherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are:\n\n1. Concave mirror\n\n2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a\n\n129",
            "128\n\nPhysics\n\nIn a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.\n\nLaws of reflection:\n\nThe incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane.\n\n2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\n7777777777777 M (0] - M\n\nFigure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.\n\n1. Regular or uniform reflection\n\n2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l\n\nFigure 8.3: Regular reflection\n\nFigure 8.4: Diffused reflection"

This occurs because the speed of light changes when it moves from one medium to another.

When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are:\n\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\n\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 .\n\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\n\n4. Light is a form of energy.\n\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\n\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object\n\nFigure 8.1",

The critical angle is the angle of incidence in the denser medium at which the refracted ray passes along the separating surface, i.e., \u2220NQR1 = 90\u00b0.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Total internal reflection occurs when a light ray travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium (e.g., from water to air) and the angle of incidence is greater than a certain angle called the critical angle. Instead of refracting out of the denser medium, the light is completely reflected back into it. This phenomenon is like a mirror effect at the boundary between the two media.\\nThe two necessary conditions for total internal reflection are:\\n1. **The light ray must be traveling from a denser medium to a rarer medium.**\\n2. **The angle of incidence in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle.** This critical angle depends on the specific pair of media involved.",

When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs. At that time the upside down image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage. /\u2018\n\nCold air\n\nFigure: 9.8\n\nZC\n\nObservation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer days you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery.

            "Physics\n\nDiffused reflection\n\nIf a parallel beam of light is incident on a surface and after reflection it is neither parallel nor converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such reflection is called diffused or irregular reflection. Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror\n\nA mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.\n\nMirrors are mainly of two types. Namely-\n\n1. Plane mirror\n\n2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.\n\nSpherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are:\n\n1. Concave mirror\n\n2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror. In this case, concave mirror is made by silvering on the convex surface of the part of the sphere [figure 8.5]. The concave mirror is a\n\n129",
            "128\n\nPhysics\n\nIn a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.\n\nLaws of reflection:\n\nThe incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane.\n\n2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\n7777777777777 M (0] - M\n\nFigure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.\n\n1. Regular or uniform reflection\n\n2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l\n\nFigure 8.3: Regular reflection\n\nFigure 8.4: Diffused reflection"

If the light ray goes straight it will follow the path BC\u2032 but it changes its path and follows BC. This phenomenon of bending of ray of light is called refraction.

            "Physics\n\n127\n\n8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are:\n\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\n\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 .\n\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\n\n4. Light is a form of energy.\n\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\n\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object\n\nFigure 8.1"

        "question": "What is the 'power' of a lens and how is it related to its focal length?",
        "answer": "Power of a lens (P) is related to its focal length (f) by the equation: 1/f = P. Given, f = +0.1m, we can calculate the power of the lens as: P = 1/f = 1/0.1 = 10D.",
        "referenceAnswer": "The power of a lens is its ability to converge or diverge light rays. A lens with a shorter focal length has a greater power, meaning it can bend light more strongly. The power of a lens is measured in diopters (D). The relationship between power (P) and focal length (f) is given by the formula: P = 1/f. This means that a lens with a focal length of 1 meter has a power of 1 diopter.",
        "referenceContext": "Now if a beam of parallel rays of light parallel to the principal axis incidents on the lens then after refraction the rays will meet at the principal focus. In the case of second lens that focal point will not be as far as the first one, rather it will be nearer. The power of a convex lens is the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam. Therefore it can be said that the power of the first lens is less than that of the second one. The power of a lens is greater if its focal length is less and the power will be less if the focal length is greater.\\nIn figure: 9.19 the refraction of parallel rays in concave lens is shown. In the case of concave lens the ability to convert a parallel beam of light into a divergent beam is called its power. The more the concave lens can diverge a beam of parallel rays the more is its power. That is the shorter the focal length of a lens, the greater is its power.\\nIn general we can say that the capacity of a lens to convert a parallel beam of light into a convergent beam or into a divergent beam is called the power of the lens.\\n1\\nThere is a relation between the power P and focal length f.

This ball is flattened in its front and back. It can rotate around a certain area in the eye cavity.\n\n2. Sclerotic: It is composed of white, strong and dense fibrous tissues [fig: 9.20].

This is called choroids. Due to this black layer light is not reflected internally within the eye.\n\nFigure: 9.20 5. Iris: Just behind the cornea, there is an opaque diaphragm. It is called Iris. The colour of the Iris may vary from person to person. Usually the colour of Iris is black, light azure or deep brown. Iris regulates the amount of light falling on the eye lens.\n\n6. Pupil: The hole at the centre of the Iris is called Pupil. Through this pupil, light enters the eyes. 7. Eye lens: It is the most important part of the eye. It is situated just behind the pupil. It is made of transparent organic substances. Its radius of curvature of the back side is greater than that of the front side. This lens is hooked in the eye ball by ciliary",

        "question": "Explain the process of accommodation in the human eye and its role in focusing on objects at different distances.",
        "answer": "Accommodation in the human eye is the process by which the eye lens changes its shape to focus on objects at different distances. This is achieved through the contraction and relaxation of the ciliary muscles that surround the lens. The change in lens shape is due to the suspension of the lens by the zonular fibers, which are attached to the ciliary muscles. When the ciliary muscles contract, the zonular fibers relax, allowing the lens to become more spherical and increase its focal length. Conversely, when the ciliary muscles relax, the zonular fibers tighten, causing the lens to become more flattened and decrease its focal length. This process allows the eye to focus on objects at varying distances, from the near point (25 cm) to infinity.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Accommodation is the ability of the human eye to adjust its focus to see objects at different distances. This is achieved by the ciliary muscles, which control the shape of the eye lens. When we look at a distant object, the ciliary muscles relax, making the eye lens thinner and reducing its curvature. This increases the focal length, allowing the image of the distant object to be focused on the retina. Conversely, when we look at a nearby object, the ciliary muscles contract, making the eye lens thicker and increasing its curvature. This shortens the focal length, focusing the image of the near object on the retina.",
        "referenceContext": "The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye.",

            "Physics\n\n155\n\nPersistence of vision: If any object is placed before our eyes an image of the object is formed in our retina. As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second. This period is called the persistence of vision.\n\nAdvantage of having two eyes: If we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye forms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the object better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. If we see an object by our two eyes the superimposition of two images will happen and we will be able to see the object clearly. 9.10 Function of an eye:\n\nWe have known earlier that there is a convex lens just behind the pupil of the eye which is called eye lens. It is necessary to change the focal length of eye lens to see the distant as well as near objects.\n\n[ Q B Py\n\nFigure: 9.21 In figure 9.21 the eye lens is shown. In front of the eye i.e. in front of the lens PQ is an object. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO coming from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real and inverted image of PQ. Where the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or nerve-fibers called rods and cones. When image or light falls on retina a kind of stimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object. It is mentionable that the inverted image of an object is formed on retina. This sensation is transmitted to the brain by the eye nerves. The brain then and there inverts the inverted image formed in the retina and we can see the object in its right shape and size.\n\n9.11 Defects of vision and its remedy The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:",
            "Physics\n\n157\n\nRemedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles. We also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye. [Fig 9.23 (c)]\n\n9.12 Perceptions of coloured object: When we see an object, then the light from the object falls on our eyes. The light being refracted by the lens of eye forms an image of the object on retina. There are numerous nerves in retina which send this perception to brain. We can see the object after the perfect analysis of the signals in the brain. The nerves that have reached the brain from retinas are called rods and cones. Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There are three types of cone cells \u2013 blue colour sensitive, red colour sensitive and green colour sensitive cone cells. It does not matter whether the colour is compound or complex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The cone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object. 9.13 Uses of refraction in our daily life:\n\nThere is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, being refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. We can see the object when a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light helps us to see an object. There are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object. By using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can see very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by telescope.\n\nThe optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the contribution of refraction of light. There are fish aquariums in many of our houses. If we keep some colour fish in the aquarium we can enjoy their interesting movement. The light from the fish coming through water at first falls on the glass of the aquarium. After the refraction of light through the glass, the sight reaches our eyes. Therefore it is also a contribution of refraction of light.",

It ultimately changes the focal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our focal length. 8. Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive membrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of some nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nerve- fibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain. Aqueous humour and Vitreous humour: The saline watery fluid that fills up the space between the eye lens and cornea is called aqueous humour. On the other hand, the jelly like substance that fills the gap between retina and eye lens is called vitreous humour.\n\nAccommodation of eye: If an object is placed before a convex lens, it forms a real image at the back of the lens. If a screen is placed at the back of the lens an inverted image of the object is found on the screen. Experiment proves that in a certain place of the screen the image is most clear. For any reason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be moved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. Now if we want to get a clear image of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths. Things happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens and vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that object is reflected on our retina, then there will be a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of different distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye. Least distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the object is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be seen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the distance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance. Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance."

This occurs when light travels from a denser medium to a less dense medium, causing the light to slow down and change direction. \n\nFor example, when you look into a glass of water, the light from the sky appears to bend and form a distorted image.

        "referenceAnswer": "Refraction of light occurs when light rays pass from one transparent medium to another, causing them to bend. This bending happens because the speed of light changes as it moves from one medium to another. A common example is when you look at a straw in a glass of water.

            "Physics\n\n127\n\n8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are:\n\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\n\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 .\n\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\n\n4. Light is a form of energy.\n\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\n\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object\n\nFigure 8.1",

The critical angle is the angle of incidence in the denser medium where the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0.\n\nIn optical fibers, total internal reflection is used to transmit signals with minimal loss of energy. When a light signal is sent through the fiber, it hits the core-cladding interface at an angle greater than the critical angle. The light is then totally reflected back into the core, allowing the signal to travel long distances with minimal attenuation. This phenomenon enables the transmission of thousands of telephone signals through a single optical fiber.",

Light can be sent through the fiber almost without any loss of energy even if it is bent or coiled. A set of optical fiber is called optical tube. Uses of optical fiber in the field of health and telecommunication: An optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner wall of the stomach of any patient. A set of optical fiber of this optical tube is sent to lighten the stomach and the other set helps to see the lightened portion of stomach from the outside. This process is known as endoscopy. In this way by sending optical tube the block inside the artery, vein and function of valves of heart can be observed. Optical fiber is used for sending or receiving electrical signals from one place to another. Before sending, the electrical signal has to be converted into optical signal. Near about 2000 telephone signals can be transmitted at a time through a single optical fiber. Almost no change takes place to the intensity of the signals for this kind of transmission.

When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs. At that time the upside down image is seen (fig 9.8) and we call it mirage. /\u2018\n\nCold air\n\nFigure: 9.8\n\nZC\n\nObservation: While walking or travelling in vehicle on a pitch covered road during summer days you may have noticed that the road is wet and silvery.

        "answer": "Myopia (short sight) and hypermetropia (long sight) are vision defects that occur due to the improper focusing of light on the retina. The main difference between the two is the focal length of the eye lens. In myopia, the focal length is too short, causing close objects to be seen clearly but distant objects to appear blurred. In hypermetropia, the focal length is too long, causing distant objects to be seen clearly but close objects to appear blurred.\n\nTo correct myopia, a concave lens is used as an aid lens or spectacles. The concave lens spreads out the light rays, reducing the focal length and allowing distant objects to be seen clearly. The focal length of the concave lens should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye.\n\nTo correct hypermetropia, a convex lens is used as an aid lens or spectacles. The convex lens converges the light rays, increasing the focal length and allowing close objects to be seen clearly. The focal length of the convex lens should be equal to the distance of the near point of the defective eye.",

This results in difficulty seeing near objects clearly. Hypermetropia is corrected using convex lenses (converging lenses) in spectacles, which converge incoming light rays, causing them to focus on the retina.",
        "referenceContext": "The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:\\n\\n1. Short sight or Myopia\\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia\\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.\\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ]\\nEffects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen\\ndistinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at\\tFigure: 9.22\\ninfinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ]\\nRemedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.\\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye.\\n2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant objects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly.\\nEffect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed\\nnearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].\\n\\nFigure: 9.23\\n\\nRemedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles.\\nWe also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye.

[Fig 9.23 (c)]\n\n9.12 Perceptions of coloured object: When we see an object, then the light from the object falls on our eyes. The light being refracted by the lens of eye forms an image of the object on retina. There are numerous nerves in retina which send this perception to brain. We can see the object after the perfect analysis of the signals in the brain. The nerves that have reached the brain from retinas are called rods and cones. Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There are three types of cone cells \u2013 blue colour sensitive, red colour sensitive and green colour sensitive cone cells. It does not matter whether the colour is compound or complex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The cone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object. 9.13 Uses of refraction in our daily life:\n\nThere is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, being refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. We can see the object when a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light helps us to see an object. There are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object. By using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can see very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by telescope.\n\nThe optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the contribution of refraction of light. There are fish aquariums in many of our houses. If we keep some colour fish in the aquarium we can enjoy their interesting movement. The light from the fish coming through water at first falls on the glass of the aquarium. After the refraction of light through the glass, the sight reaches our eyes. Therefore it is also a contribution of refraction of light.",
            "156\n\nPhysics\n\n1. Short sight or Myopia\n\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia\n\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight. Cause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ] Effects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen distinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at Figure: 9.22 infinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ] Remedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles. Besides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye. 2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant objects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly.\n\n\u00ab\u201425em\u2014> _\u2014 S _ \u2014 =t \u00a9) Effect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed nearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].\n\nFigure: 9.23",

It ultimately changes the focal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our focal length. 8. Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive membrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of some nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nerve- fibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain. Aqueous humour and Vitreous humour: The saline watery fluid that fills up the space between the eye lens and cornea is called aqueous humour. On the other hand, the jelly like substance that fills the gap between retina and eye lens is called vitreous humour.\n\nAccommodation of eye: If an object is placed before a convex lens, it forms a real image at the back of the lens. If a screen is placed at the back of the lens an inverted image of the object is found on the screen. Experiment proves that in a certain place of the screen the image is most clear. For any reason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be moved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. Now if we want to get a clear image of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths. Things happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens and vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that object is reflected on our retina, then there will be a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of different distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye. Least distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the object is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be seen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the distance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance. Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance."

            "Physics\n\n157\n\nRemedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles. We also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye. [Fig 9.23 (c)]\n\n9.12 Perceptions of coloured object: When we see an object, then the light from the object falls on our eyes. The light being refracted by the lens of eye forms an image of the object on retina. There are numerous nerves in retina which send this perception to brain. We can see the object after the perfect analysis of the signals in the brain. The nerves that have reached the brain from retinas are called rods and cones. Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There are three types of cone cells \u2013 blue colour sensitive, red colour sensitive and green colour sensitive cone cells. It does not matter whether the colour is compound or complex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The cone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object. 9.13 Uses of refraction in our daily life:\n\nThere is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, being refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. We can see the object when a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light helps us to see an object. There are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object. By using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can see very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by telescope.\n\nThe optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the contribution of refraction of light. There are fish aquariums in many of our houses. If we keep some colour fish in the aquarium we can enjoy their interesting movement. The light from the fish coming through water at first falls on the glass of the aquarium. After the refraction of light through the glass, the sight reaches our eyes. Therefore it is also a contribution of refraction of light.",
            "Physics\n\n155\n\nPersistence of vision: If any object is placed before our eyes an image of the object is formed in our retina. As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second. This period is called the persistence of vision.\n\nAdvantage of having two eyes: If we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye forms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the object better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. If we see an object by our two eyes the superimposition of two images will happen and we will be able to see the object clearly. 9.10 Function of an eye:\n\nWe have known earlier that there is a convex lens just behind the pupil of the eye which is called eye lens. It is necessary to change the focal length of eye lens to see the distant as well as near objects.\n\n[ Q B Py\n\nFigure: 9.21 In figure 9.21 the eye lens is shown. In front of the eye i.e. in front of the lens PQ is an object. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO coming from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real and inverted image of PQ. Where the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or nerve-fibers called rods and cones. When image or light falls on retina a kind of stimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object. It is mentionable that the inverted image of an object is formed on retina. This sensation is transmitted to the brain by the eye nerves. The brain then and there inverts the inverted image formed in the retina and we can see the object in its right shape and size.\n\n9.11 Defects of vision and its remedy The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:",

It ultimately changes the focal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our focal length. 8. Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive membrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of some nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nerve- fibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain. Aqueous humour and Vitreous humour: The saline watery fluid that fills up the space between the eye lens and cornea is called aqueous humour. On the other hand, the jelly like substance that fills the gap between retina and eye lens is called vitreous humour.\n\nAccommodation of eye: If an object is placed before a convex lens, it forms a real image at the back of the lens. If a screen is placed at the back of the lens an inverted image of the object is found on the screen. Experiment proves that in a certain place of the screen the image is most clear. For any reason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be moved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. Now if we want to get a clear image of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths. Things happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens and vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that object is reflected on our retina, then there will be a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of different distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye. Least distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the object is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be seen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the distance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance. Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance."

        "referenceContext": "The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:\\n\\n1. Short sight or Myopia\\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia\\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.\\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ]\\nEffects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig. 9.22 a). As a result, objects are not seen\\ndistinctly. For this kind of eye, the far point is not situated at\\tFigure: 9.22\\ninfinity. Rather, it is a certain finite point F. For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ]\\nRemedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.\\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye. They should have such focal length or power so that due to refraction through the image of an object placed at infinity the image is formed at the far point of the defective eye [ fig 9.22 c]. We know that when the object is at infinity its virtual image is formed at the principal focus of the concave lens. Therefore, the focal length of the concave lens used as spectacles should be equal to the distance of the far point of the defective eye.\\n2. Long sight or hypermetropia: If any eye has this type of defect, it can see distant objects distinctly but cannot see near objects distinctly.\\nEffect of such problem: In such a case, rays coming from the object placed at the near point of a normal eye, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I behind the retina [Fig. 9.23 (a)]. As a result, the image becomes blurred. The near point N of such an eye shifts away to O, which is more than 25 cm (the distance of the near point for a normal eye). Therefore, such a defective eye cannot see any objects distinctly, which is placed\\nnearer to O [Fig 9.23 (b)].\\n\\nFigure: 9.23\\n\\nRemedy: It is already said that such defect of eye arises due to the decrease in the power of convergence of the eye lens. Therefore, to rectify the defect, the power of convergence of the eye lens should be increased. For this, convex lens of suitable focal length i.e. of suitable power should be used as aid lens or spectacles.\\nWe also know that only a convex lens can provide a virtual and erect image at a distance greater than that of the object. For this reason, a convex lens of suitable focal length or power is used in this case as aid lens or spectacles in front of the eye. The focal length of this lens should be such so that due to the refraction the virtual image of an object placed at normal near point N, is formed at the near point O of the defective eye.

The light being refracted by the lens of eye forms an image of the object on retina. There are numerous nerves in retina which send this perception to brain. We can see the object after the perfect analysis of the signals in the brain. The nerves that have reached the brain from retinas are called rods and cones. Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There are three types of cone cells \u2013 blue colour sensitive, red colour sensitive and green colour sensitive cone cells. It does not matter whether the colour is compound or complex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The cone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object. 9.13 Uses of refraction in our daily life:\n\nThere is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, being refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. We can see the object when a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light helps us to see an object. There are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object. By using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can see very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by telescope.\n\nThe optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the contribution of refraction of light. There are fish aquariums in many of our houses. If we keep some colour fish in the aquarium we can enjoy their interesting movement. The light from the fish coming through water at first falls on the glass of the aquarium. After the refraction of light through the glass, the sight reaches our eyes. Therefore it is also a contribution of refraction of light.",

            "214\n\nPhysics Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system. 13.8. Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons.

        "answer": "Refraction of light occurs when a light ray passes from one transparent medium to another, changing its path due to a change in speed. The speed of light decreases when it travels from a rarer medium to a denser medium, causing the refracted ray to bend towards the normal.

            "Physics\n\n127\n\n8.1 Nature of light We know, light is a form of energy by which we are able to see the objects. When light comes from an object to our eyes, we see the object at that time. The light entered into the eyes forms an image of the object in the retina and develops a sense of vision similar to the object in our brain through a complex process. Men have been trying to achieve knowledge about the nature of light from an ancient period. Once it was thought that light falls on an object from our eyes, so we see that object. Actually, when light comes to our eyes from an object, only then we can see the object. The major properties of light are:\n\n1. Light travels in a straightway through a transparent homogeneous medium.\n\n2. Light travels with a definite velocity in a definite medium. The value of this velocity in vacuum is c = \u00d7 3 10 8 ms-1 .\n\n3. Reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion and polarization of light take place.\n\n4. Light is a form of energy.\n\n5. Light is a kind of electromagnetic wave.\n\n6. Light behaves as wave in some cases and also as particle in some incidents. 8.2 Laws of reflection of light We see many kinds of objects around us. Some of them give off light all around and some are not. The objects (such as- sun, star, lighted candle etc.) emit light of their own are called luminous objects. Conversely, objects (such as men, trees, table, wall, picture, chalk board etc.) that have no light of their own or do not emit light are called non- luminous objects. When light comes from the luminous object to our eyes we see the object. The common objects which we see around us are not luminous; in spite of this we can see them. The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat. luminous object non-luminous object\n\nFigure 8.1",
            "128\n\nPhysics\n\nIn a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.\n\nLaws of reflection:\n\nThe incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane.\n\n2. Second law: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.\n\n7777777777777 M (0] - M\n\nFigure 8.2: Reflection of light When light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.\n\n1. Regular or uniform reflection\n\n2. Diffused or irregular reflection 1. Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l\n\nFigure 8.3: Regular reflection\n\nFigure 8.4: Diffused reflection"

When he comes close to the tree he realizes his mistake that there is no water. This happens due to total internal reflection of light. This very event is called mirage. The sandy surface of desert is rapidly heated by the tremendous heat coming from the sun. So, the layers of air in contact with the sandy surface become hot. As a result the lower layers become hot and lighter but the upper layers are comparatively colder and denser. The ray of light coming from the tree enters continuously into rarer medium from denser medium. As a result the refracted ray continues to go away from the normal. In a certain moment the ray of light incidents on a layer at an angle which is greater than the critical angle and total internal reflection occurs.

Figure 8.4 shows that a parallel beam of light incidents on a rough surface. In this case, the rays incident at different angles at different point of incidence on the rough surface, as a result the corresponding angle of reflection of these rays become different. Due to this, the reflected rays are no more parallel. Objects which we see around us, most of their surfaces are not smooth. As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objects appear dim instead of bright. Most of the surfaces which appear smooth to naked eyes actually are not smooth. When these objects are viewed with a microscope then they appear rough. 8.3 Mirror\n\nA mirror is a smooth surface on which regular reflection takes place. A clear image of an object placed in front of a mirror is formed due to reflection of light. A mirror is made by giving a reflecting coating on a smooth surface. Generally a mirror is prepared by giving metal coating on one surface of glass. This process of coating with mercury or silver on glass is called silvering. Here, the surface opposite to the surface having metal coating works as the reflecting surface. Besides, surface of calm water, smooth ice etc. works as mirror.\n\nMirrors are mainly of two types. Namely-\n\n1. Plane mirror\n\n2. Spherical mirror Plane mirror: If the reflecting surface is plane and smooth and regular reflection of light takes place on it, then this surface is called plane mirror. The mirror which we usually use is plane mirror.\n\nSpherical mirror If the reflecting surface is smooth and spherical, that means if the reflecting surface is a part of a sphere and regular reflection takes place on it, it is called spherical mirror. Spherical mirrors are shown in figures 8.5 and 8.6. If a part of a hollow glass sphere is cut off and silvering is done on one surface, then a spherical mirror is made. Again, spherical mirrors are of two types. These are:\n\n1. Concave mirror\n\n2. Convex mirror Concave mirror: If the concave surface of a sphere acts as the reflector, that is if regular reflection of light takes place from the concave surface of the spherical mirror, then it is called a concave mirror.

But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.\n\nLaws of reflection:\n\nThe incident and reflected ray obey two simple laws: 1. First law: The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence on the reflector lie in the same plane.\n\n2.

Regular reflection: If a parallel beam of light falls on a smooth surface and after reflection remains parallel, or is converted into a convergent or a divergent beam, then such type of reflection is called regular reflection. For example- when a parallel beam of light incident on a plane mirror or on a well polished metal surface, the beam remains parallel even after reflection. In this case, the angle of incidence for each incident ray is the same and the angle of reflection for each of the ray is also the same due to regular reflection. i \\4 \\ l\n\nFigure 8.3: Regular reflection\n\nFigure 8.4: Diffused reflection"

        "question": "What is the function of the eye lens? How does it adjust to focus on objects at different distances?",
        "answer": "The eye lens is a convex lens situated just behind the pupil. Its function is to change the focal length to see objects at different distances. The eye lens adjusts its shape and focal length through the contraction and suspension of ciliary muscles and suspensor ligaments. This adjustment allows the eye lens to change its curvature and ultimately change the focal length, enabling the eye to focus on objects at various distances.",
        "referenceAnswer": "The eye lens is a convex lens located behind the pupil. It is responsible for focusing light onto the retina at the back of the eye. The eye lens can change its shape through a process called accommodation, allowing it to focus on objects at different distances. When we look at a distant object, the ciliary muscles relax, making the eye lens thinner and reducing its curvature. This increases the focal length, allowing the image of the distant object to be focused on the retina. Conversely, when we look at a nearby object, the ciliary muscles contract, making the eye lens thicker and increasing its curvature. This shortens the focal length, focusing the image of the near object on the retina.",
        "referenceContext": "The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye.",

            "Physics\n\n155\n\nPersistence of vision: If any object is placed before our eyes an image of the object is formed in our retina. As a result of it, we see the object. For any reason, if the object is removed from our eyes, a sensation of that object stays in our brain for about 0.1 second. This period is called the persistence of vision.\n\nAdvantage of having two eyes: If we see an object by our two eyes we can only see a single object. Though each eye forms individual images on their own retinas but the brain combines the two images to make a single one. We can measure the distance accurately for having two eyes. So, it is very difficult to thread a needle keeping one eye closed. Apart from that, due to the relative position of our eyes with respect to the object we see the right portion of the object better with our right eye and the left portion better with our left eye. If we see an object by our two eyes the superimposition of two images will happen and we will be able to see the object clearly. 9.10 Function of an eye:\n\nWe have known earlier that there is a convex lens just behind the pupil of the eye which is called eye lens. It is necessary to change the focal length of eye lens to see the distant as well as near objects.\n\n[ Q B Py\n\nFigure: 9.21 In figure 9.21 the eye lens is shown. In front of the eye i.e. in front of the lens PQ is an object. A ray of light PR coming from P parallel to the principal axis incidents at R and is refracted through the principal focus F along the path RFP1. Another ray PO coming from P passes through the optical centre O and is refracted along the path OP1. The refracted rays RP1 and OP1 meet at point P1. From point P1 a perpendicular P1Q1 is drawn on the principal axis. So, P1Q1 is the real and inverted image of PQ. Where the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or nerve-fibers called rods and cones. When image or light falls on retina a kind of stimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object. It is mentionable that the inverted image of an object is formed on retina. This sensation is transmitted to the brain by the eye nerves. The brain then and there inverts the inverted image formed in the retina and we can see the object in its right shape and size.\n\n9.11 Defects of vision and its remedy The range of vision of a normal eye is 25 cm to infinite distance. This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:",

SO, distance of real object, distance of real image and distance of real focus are all taken to be positive. All virtual distances are negative. Distance of virtual object, distance of virtual image and distance of virtual focus are all taken to be virtual distance. Focal length of convex lens is positive and focal length of concave lens is negative.\n\nMathematical example 9.3: If the focal length of a lens is +0.1m then what is the power of the lens?\n\nWe know,\n\n1 f 1 +0.1 = 10D\n\nGiven, Focal length, f = +0.1m Power, P =?\n\n9.9 Human eye The structure and functions of human eyes are similar to a camera.

This ball is flattened in its front and back. It can rotate around a certain area in the eye cavity.\n\n2. Sclerotic: It is composed of white, strong and dense fibrous tissues [fig: 9.20].

This is called choroids. Due to this black layer light is not reflected internally within the eye.\n\nFigure: 9.20 5. Iris: Just behind the cornea, there is an opaque diaphragm. It is called Iris. The colour of the Iris may vary from person to person. Usually the colour of Iris is black, light azure or deep brown. Iris regulates the amount of light falling on the eye lens.\n\n6. Pupil: The hole at the centre of the Iris is called Pupil. Through this pupil, light enters the eyes. 7. Eye lens: It is the most important part of the eye. It is situated just behind the pupil. It is made of transparent organic substances. Its radius of curvature of the back side is greater than that of the front side. This lens is hooked in the eye ball by ciliary",
            "154\n\nPhysics\n\nmuscles and suspensor ligaments. Due to the contractions and suspension of these muscles and ligaments, the curvature of the lens changes. It ultimately changes the focal length. To see different objects of near and distance, we need to adjust our focal length. 8. Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive membrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of some nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nerve- fibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain. Aqueous humour and Vitreous humour: The saline watery fluid that fills up the space between the eye lens and cornea is called aqueous humour. On the other hand, the jelly like substance that fills the gap between retina and eye lens is called vitreous humour.\n\nAccommodation of eye: If an object is placed before a convex lens, it forms a real image at the back of the lens. If a screen is placed at the back of the lens an inverted image of the object is found on the screen. Experiment proves that in a certain place of the screen the image is most clear. For any reason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be moved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. Now if we want to get a clear image of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths. Things happen in a similar way in case of eyes. The cornea, aqueous humour, eye lens and vitreous humour together work as a convergent lens system. If any object is placed before our eyes and if the image of that object is reflected on our retina, then there will be a sensation of vision in the brain. As a result, we see the object. We see objects of different distances through our eyes. The specialty of the eye lens is that it changes its shape according to the necessity and thus it changes its focal length. Due to the change of the focal length, image of objects at any position is always formed at the same distance from the lens. Therefore, clear images are formed on the retina. The capacity of eyes to change their focal length to see objects of any distance is called the accommodation power of eyes. And the process is called accommodation of eye. Least distance of distinct vision: From our daily experience, we see that the closer the object is to the eyes the clearer it is to see. But, there is a point after which it cannot be seen clearly. The nearest point at which eyes can see without any difficulty is called the distance of distinct vision. For any normal eye, this distance is nearly 25cm. So, the near point of a normal eye is 25 cm away from the eye. It is difficult for our eyes to see any object clearly that stays closer to this distance. Again, the distance which is maximum from the eye to see an object is called the farthest distance of distinct vision. It is also called the far point of the eye. The far point of any normal eye is at infinity. This means that a normal eye can see up to a huge distance."

As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov.

Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators.

This flow of electron continues until the potential difference between the two bodies becomes zero. If by any process the potential difference between the two objects is maintained, then this flow of electron goes on continuously. This continuous flow of electrons is electric current. The amount of charge that flows in unit time through any cross section of a conductor is called electric current. If through any cross section of a conductor, the quantity of charge\n\nQ flows in time t, then the electric current will be I = Unit: The unit of electric current is ampere. If an amount of charge 1 C flows in 1 second through any cross section of a conductor, then the quantity of electric current produced is called 1 A.

It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current.

Now the physicists have discovered that proton and neutron are formed of more smaller particles. The study of physics helps not only to understand and explain the natural events but also its application plays a vital role in other branches of science. At present physics is at the centre probably because of its application in other branches of science. The discovery of electron at the end of ninetieth century made possible to invent electron microscope which has brought about a revolution in material science and Cytology. In physics there is development of theories and application mathematics at the same time it has practical application and engineering application too. Physics is very essential to give fundamental explanation and form idea about Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy, Meteorology etc. In addition, there is wide application of methodology and instruments of physics in Biology, Oceanology, Psychology and Medical Science. Physics describes the laws of nature: The natural world that we live in follows some certain laws e.g. Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, law of conservation of energy etc. Since our childhood we have been acquiring these laws through our personal experiences which are very essential for our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature but can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about them. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation. Development of technology results from the proper application of fundamental laws of physics :\n\nWe have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how television works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth, , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using internet the whole world can be explored in a moment . The discovered laws of physics pave the way to invent these technologies. Study of physics is a perfect human training :\n\nWe can achieve new idea by the study of physics. Physics instructs on how to think, show cause, how to put argument, how to utilize logic and mathematics. It stimulates our imagination and develops the power of thinking.\n\nPhysics teaches how to carry out observation:\n\nWe can develop our capability of observation. We can also learn how to carry out systematic observations by studying physics properly",
            "52\n\nPhysics\n\nThe four fundamental forces which exist in nature are:\n\n1. Force of gravitation\n\n2. Electromagnetic force\n\n3. Weak nuclear force\n\n4. Strong nuclear force\n\nForce of Gravitation: In this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual attraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation. The planets of the solar system are revolving round the Sun due to force of gravitation. The range of gravitation extends to infinity.\n\nElectromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force is defined as the force exerted by two charged particles or bodies on each other due to their charges. This force may be of both types- attractive or repulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between the charged particles. Weak nuclear force\n\nThe short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles within the nucleus is called weak nuclear force. Due to this force the nucleus becomes unstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to weak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 10-16 m.\n\nStrong nuclear force It is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of an atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10-15 m which is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental forces."

        "answer": "Electrostatic induction is a process where a neutral object becomes charged due to the presence of a charged object. When a charged object is brought near a neutral object, it induces opposite charges on the neutral object. The process involves the transfer of electrons from the neutral object to the charged object, resulting in the neutral object becoming charged.\n\nIn the case of a conductor, the induced charges are distributed evenly across the surface of the conductor. The near end of the conductor becomes negatively charged, while the far end becomes positively charged. This is because the electrons are transferred from the neutral conductor to the charged object, leaving behind a positive charge on the near end of the conductor.\n\nThe process of electrostatic induction can be explained by the following steps:\n\n1. A charged object is brought near a neutral object.\n2. The charged object induces opposite charges on the neutral object.\n3. The electrons are transferred from the neutral object to the charged object.\n4.

Strong nuclear force\n\nForce of Gravitation: In this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual attraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation. The planets of the solar system are revolving round the Sun due to force of gravitation. The range of gravitation extends to infinity.\n\nElectromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force is defined as the force exerted by two charged particles or bodies on each other due to their charges. This force may be of both types- attractive or repulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between the charged particles. Weak nuclear force\n\nThe short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles within the nucleus is called weak nuclear force. Due to this force the nucleus becomes unstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to weak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 10-16 m.\n\nStrong nuclear force It is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of an atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10-15 m which is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental forces.",

Now the physicists have discovered that proton and neutron are formed of more smaller particles. The study of physics helps not only to understand and explain the natural events but also its application plays a vital role in other branches of science. At present physics is at the centre probably because of its application in other branches of science. The discovery of electron at the end of ninetieth century made possible to invent electron microscope which has brought about a revolution in material science and Cytology. In physics there is development of theories and application mathematics at the same time it has practical application and engineering application too. Physics is very essential to give fundamental explanation and form idea about Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy, Meteorology etc. In addition, there is wide application of methodology and instruments of physics in Biology, Oceanology, Psychology and Medical Science. Physics describes the laws of nature: The natural world that we live in follows some certain laws e.g. Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, law of conservation of energy etc. Since our childhood we have been acquiring these laws through our personal experiences which are very essential for our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature but can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about them. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation. Development of technology results from the proper application of fundamental laws of physics :\n\nWe have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how television works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth, , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using internet the whole world can be explored in a moment .

Physics instructs on how to think, show cause, how to put argument, how to utilize logic and mathematics. It stimulates our imagination and develops the power of thinking.\n\nPhysics teaches how to carry out observation:\n\nWe can develop our capability of observation.

        "question": "Describe the process of electrification by friction. Provide an example and explain how the charges are distributed.",
        "answer": "Electrification by friction is a process where two objects come into contact and transfer electrons from one object to another, resulting in the transfer of charge. This process can occur between two objects that are in contact, such as when you rub a balloon on your hair, or between two objects that are not in contact, such as when you rub a piece of cloth on a balloon.\n\nExample: When you rub a balloon on your hair, the electrons from your hair are transferred to the balloon, resulting in the balloon becoming negatively charged. The electrons that are transferred to the balloon are called conduction electrons.\n\nThe process of electrification by friction can be explained as follows:\n\n1. When two objects come into contact, the electrons in the outermost layer of the atoms of one object are transferred to the other object.\n2. The object that loses electrons becomes positively charged, while the object that gains electrons becomes negatively charged.\n3. The transferred electrons are called conduction electrons, and they are free to move within the material.\n4. The distribution of charges can be explained by the concept of polarization, where the electrons are distributed unevenly within the material, resulting in a net charge.\n\nIn the case of the comb and the paper, the comb is likely to be negatively charged due to the transfer of electrons from the comb to the paper. This is because the comb is rubbed against the paper, resulting in the transfer of electrons from the comb to the paper. The paper, on the other hand, becomes positively charged due to the loss of electrons.",

While combing his hair he observed surprisingly that he cannot do it because all the hair was becoming straight and repels away each other. As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov. Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper.\n\nWe see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged. We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different. As long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically neutral. But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If the number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scattered electrons are joined with any atom, the number of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or excess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged. The substances through which electricity or electric charge can pass easily are called conductors, e.g. metal, soil, human body etc. Generally the metals are good conductors. Copper, silver, aluminium etc are good conductors. On the other hand the substances through which electricity or electric charge cannot pass easily are called nonconductors or insulator, such as wood, paper, glass etc.\n\n10.2 Electrification by friction: Experiment: Suspend a light pith ball freely with a string from a stand or a hook.

Spray gun is made in such a way that it produces very small charged particles of colour. The sharp edge of the painting spray gun is connected to a terminal of the static electrical generator. The other terminal of the generator is connected to the metal plate to be coloured which must Figure: 10.16 be connected with earth. In case of colouring a car the charged small particle emitted from the spray gun attracts the outer frame of the car. As a result a uniform layer of colour is formed on the outer surface of the car. Moreover these small particles move along the electric lines of force and reach the narrower places of its surface and colour it. 2. Ink Jet Printer: This is the most ordinary printer which remains connected to the computer. An ink-gun with its narrow mouth projects very small particles of ink. These small particles are positively charged. These ink particles move through the space between two plates. These positively charged ink particles are repelled by the positive plate and attracted by the negative plate.\n\n> small ink particles Positively charged\n\nFigure: 10.17 A computer controls the voltage of the plates in such a way that the plates are sometimes positively charged and sometimes negatively charged. And the ink particles fall on moving paper scattered in different places to give the necessary shape of letters and pictures. For colour print four kinds of colour are used. 3. Photocopier: Nowadays photocopier or photocopy machine is very essential and thus it has become very popular machine. Not only the educational institutions and other offices but also general people use this machine to photocopy any kind of necessary papers and documents. Static energy is also used in this machine. There is a rotating dram inside the dark part of the photocopier. Positive charge is sprayed over the dram. A bright light lights up the page to be photocopied. The white part of the page reflects light but the dark or printed part does not reflect light. The reflected light centers on the dram. Charges releases from the part of the dram where the reflected light from white paper falls. Only the dark part of the dram is charged positively. Negatively charged ink of carbon powder (toner) is sprayed over the dram. Negatively charged ink particles get stick to the positively charged part of the dram. A piece of white paper is positively charged and is kept pressed with the dram. This paper picks up the pattern of carbon powder on its surface from the dram. Positively charged paper attracts the negatively charged toner. Then the paper is passed through the heated roller. As a result the ink of the toner gets melted and mixed with the paper and makes a permanent copy."

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators.

            "Physics\n\n179\n\ninsulators. For example: Plastic, rubber, wood, glass etc. There are no free electrons inside insulating materials. Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A.

So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell.

While combing his hair he observed surprisingly that he cannot do it because all the hair was becoming straight and repels away each other. As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov. Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper.\n\nWe see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged. We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different. As long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically neutral. But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If the number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scattered electrons are joined with any atom, the number of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or excess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged. The substances through which electricity or electric charge can pass easily are called conductors, e.g. metal, soil, human body etc. Generally the metals are good conductors. Copper, silver, aluminium etc are good conductors. On the other hand the substances through which electricity or electric charge cannot pass easily are called nonconductors or insulator, such as wood, paper, glass etc.\n\n10.2 Electrification by friction: Experiment: Suspend a light pith ball freely with a string from a stand or a hook.

When a charged body is brought near the electroscope, the leaves move apart if the body is negatively charged and move together if the body is positively charged. The construction of an electroscope typically includes a metal rod or wire that connects the leaves to a metal plate, and a metal base that provides a path for the electric charge to flow.

Here, the galvanometer is a device that can detect the existence of flow of current. It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current.

Strong nuclear force\n\nForce of Gravitation: In this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual attraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation. The planets of the solar system are revolving round the Sun due to force of gravitation. The range of gravitation extends to infinity.\n\nElectromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force is defined as the force exerted by two charged particles or bodies on each other due to their charges. This force may be of both types- attractive or repulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between the charged particles. Weak nuclear force\n\nThe short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles within the nucleus is called weak nuclear force. Due to this force the nucleus becomes unstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to weak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 10-16 m.\n\nStrong nuclear force It is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of an atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10-15 m which is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental forces.",

At present physics is at the centre probably because of its application in other branches of science. The discovery of electron at the end of ninetieth century made possible to invent electron microscope which has brought about a revolution in material science and Cytology.

While combing his hair he observed surprisingly that he cannot do it because all the hair was becoming straight and repels away each other. As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov. Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper.\n\nWe see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged. We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different. As long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically neutral. But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If the number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scattered electrons are joined with any atom, the number of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or excess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged. The substances through which electricity or electric charge can pass easily are called conductors, e.g. metal, soil, human body etc. Generally the metals are good conductors. Copper, silver, aluminium etc are good conductors. On the other hand the substances through which electricity or electric charge cannot pass easily are called nonconductors or insulator, such as wood, paper, glass etc.\n\n10.2 Electrification by friction: Experiment: Suspend a light pith ball freely with a string from a stand or a hook.

Again when a charged body is brought in contact with another neutral body the later is charged. When the neutral body is placed not in contact with the charged body but close to the charged body, the former becomes charged. This happens due to induction. The process of charging a neutral body by bringing it very near to the charged body is called electrostatic induction.

One end of the rod is brought very near to the neutral conductor rod AB keeping the other end of the glass rod in hand [Fig: 10.4(a)]. As a result the free electrons of the conductor are attracted by the positive charges of the glass rod and move the end A. Therefore, the end B falls in short of electrons and is charged positively. The end A is charged negatively. With a charge collector [a small metal sheet attached to a nonconductor handle] if some charges are collected from end B and their nature is detected with the help of an electroscope then the above discussion will be proved.",

A metallic circular disk is fixed on the top of brass or any metallic rod R [Fig: 10.7] and at lower end of the rod two light leaves of gold are attached. Instead of gold aluminium or any other light metal can also be used. The lower end of the rod with the leaves is placed in a glass jar passing through a cork of nonconductor matter C. As the apparatus is kept inside a glass jar, the humidity and the wind cannot damage the instrument. Charging the electroscope: If a glass rod is rubbed with silk, it becomes positively charged. If that charged rod is attached to the disk or sphere of the electroscope, some charge is transferred from the rod to the disk. This charge reaches to the gold leaves through conducting metal rod.

It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential.

Strong nuclear force\n\nForce of Gravitation: In this universe every body attracts each other by a force towards them. The mutual attraction between any two bodies of the universe is called gravitation. This attraction occurs due to mass of the bodies. The force of gravitation is comparatively weak among the fundamental forces. Weight of us is the consequence of gravitation. The planets of the solar system are revolving round the Sun due to force of gravitation. The range of gravitation extends to infinity.\n\nElectromagnetic force: The electromagnetic force is defined as the force exerted by two charged particles or bodies on each other due to their charges. This force may be of both types- attractive or repulsive. When the charged particles are at rest, only electric force works between them. The magnetic force is created simultaneously in addition to the electric force between the particles when the charged particles are mobile. The force of attraction or repulsion between two magnetic poles is also electromagnetic force. The electric force acting between two charged fundamental particles is more powerful than the force of gravitation between them. Nevertheless, electric force is of medium type considering strength. Frictional force, spring force etc. are produced due to electric forces between the charged particles. Weak nuclear force\n\nThe short range and small magnitude force that exists between the fundamental particles within the nucleus is called weak nuclear force. Due to this force the nucleus becomes unstable and beta decay occurs. Most of the radioactive disintegration occurs due to weak nuclear force. The range of this force is less than 10-16 m.\n\nStrong nuclear force It is known that there are two particles namely proton and neutron within the nucleus of an atom. These particles are called nucleon. The strong force that exists between two nucleons within the nucleus of an atom is called strong nuclear force. This force bounds the nucleons together. The strong nuclear force is responsible for the stability of the nucleus. This force is very short range and attractive. The range of this force is 10-15 m which is the radius of the nucleus. This force is the strongest among the fundamental forces.",

It consists of a metal rod or wire suspended between two metal leaves, which are connected to a metal disk. The leaves are usually coated with a thin layer of metal, such as gold or aluminum.\n\nWhen a charged body is brought near the electroscope, the leaves move apart if the body is negatively charged and move together if the body is positively charged.

It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A.

As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential.

As soon as Sourov brings the comb close to the tale he observes the comb attracting some pieces of paper on the table. Some of you may have the same kind of experience like Sourov. In our daily life we observe that many objects around us behave like the comb of Sourov. Do it yourself: Rub your dry hair with your plastic scale for a while and hold it near some pieces of paper.\n\nWe see that an object attracts another object in a special condition or becomes charged that is electricity produced in the object. Their charge remains static in the place of its production. So it is called static electricity. Now let us see what we mean by being charged. We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different. As long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically neutral. But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If the number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scattered electrons are joined with any atom, the number of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or excess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged. The substances through which electricity or electric charge can pass easily are called conductors, e.g. metal, soil, human body etc. Generally the metals are good conductors. Copper, silver, aluminium etc are good conductors. On the other hand the substances through which electricity or electric charge cannot pass easily are called nonconductors or insulator, such as wood, paper, glass etc.\n\n10.2 Electrification by friction: Experiment: Suspend a light pith ball freely with a string from a stand or a hook. Rub one end of a glass rod with a piece of dry silk cloth very well. It will be more convenient if the glass rod and the silk are dried to make them warm.

In a neutral atom, the number of protons (positive charge) is equal to the number of electrons (negative charge). However, atoms have an affinity for excess electrons, which is different in different substances.

If the two leaves move away from each other then it is understood that there is an existence of charge in the body but if they don\u2019t move away from each other then it is understood that the body has no charge.\n\nDetection of the nature of charge: To know the nature of charge in any charged body, the electroscope should be charged either positively or negatively.

Since the unit of work is joule (J) and the unit of time is second (s), the unit of power will be Joule/second (J/s). It is called Watt. Watt is denoted by W.\n\nIf one joule work is done in one second or the rate of transformation of energy is called one watt.\n\n1W = 1J 1S = 1 Js-1\n\nSince watt is very smaller, its thousand times larger unit kilo-watt is used.\n\n1 kilo-watt = 1000 watt You have probably heard the word \u201cHorse Power\u201d. This unit of power was used earlier.\n\nStill today this unit is sometimes used to mean the power of a motor or a car.\n\n1 Horse Power = 746 watt Have you heard the word \u201ckilowatt-hour\u201d? What does it mean? Actually it is the unit of work or energy. We usually pay the bill of electricity of houses, factories etc measured in this unit. One kilowatt-hour means the energy that a machine with a power of one kilowatt uses in one hour. 60 watt mark on a bulb means that it transforms 60 Joules electrical energy to light and heat energy in one second. 200 megawatt power of an electrical power station means that it supplies 200000000 joules energy in one second. We are using this energy in houses, factories and offices.\n\nMathematical Example 4.4: A person of mass 70 kg can stair up 30 steps of 25 cm height each in 15 s. What is his power? (g = 9.8 ms-2) Here, Mass of the person, m = 70 kg We know, Work P= = Time Fs t = 686 N x 7.5 m 15 s Force = Weight of the person = mg = 70 kg x 9.8 ms-2 = 686 N Displacement, S = 35 x 25 cm = 750 cm = 343 W = 7.5 m Ans: 343 W Time, t=15s Power, P = ? Do it: Count the number of steps of the stairs to reach the roof of your school or house or any other building. Measure the height of the roof in meter. Measure your mass with the help of a weight measuring machine in kilogram. Multiply your mass with 9.8 and then you will find your weight in newton. Then run to the top of the roof. Measure the total time of reaching the roof with the help of a stop watch.\n\nYour work done will be, your weight \u00d7 total height Work done Your power will be, your total work done \u00f7 total time i.e., .\n\nTotal Time\n\nPerform these activities with your friends and compare your power with them.

If the current at the points P, Q and R is measured by an ammeter, then it will be found that\n\nI = I 1 + I 2\n\nHere, total current of the circuit i.e. in a parallel circuit, the sum of the individual currents flowing through each of the parallel branches is equal to the total current.\n\nThe electrical appliances such as- light, fan etc. which we use in houses or offices is connected in parallel to the AC mains. Each of the appliances gets the same voltage supply due to parallel connection. But they get different amounts of current.\n\n11.11 Equivalent resistance and its uses in circuit Sometimes several resistances are connected together for different purposes. Connection of more than one resistance together is called combination of resistances.\n\nEquivalent resistance: If a single resistance is used instead of combination of resistances and if the current and potential difference is not changed in the circuit, then that resistance is called the equivalent resistance of the combination. Combination of resistances is of two types, e.g. - series combination and parallel combination.\n\nSeries combination of resistances\n\nFigure shows resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in series.

Here, the galvanometer is a device that can detect the existence of flow of current. It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current.

The lines of force of an electric field produced by two unequal positive charges placed nearby are shown in figure 10.11(d). In this case, the neutral point \u2018N\u2019 would not be nearer to the smaller charges.\n\n10.7 Electric Potential As there is intensity of an electric field, it also has electric potential. Potential determines the direction of motion of a charge in an electric field and also determines the direction in which the charge will flow when two charged conductors are connected by a conductor wire. If the charge creating field is positive, some work is done against the force of repulsion if another positive charge is brought near it. Therefore, the more positive charge is brought from a point at infinity nearer to the body, the more work will have to be done. So, within the electric field of a positively charged body, the more a point is brought nearer to the body, the more will be the quantity of potential. If any electric field created by a positively charged body and a free positive charge is placed and allowed to move freely, it would go away from the body. Therefore, we can say that positive charge moves from higher potential to lower potential. On the other hand, negative charge moves towards positively charged body. Thus, negative charge moves from lower potential to higher potential. If the body creating the electric field is charged negatively, then some work will be done due to attraction of a unit positive charge bringing towards it. A positive charge itself does work while coming from infinity towards a negatively charged body, which creates an electric field. As a result the charge loses energy and the potential at a point in the electric field is considered as negative. Measurement of potential: The work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to a point in an electric field is called the potential of that point. Again from infinity if a unit of positive charge is brought near to the conductor, the work done by the electric force or against the electric force is called potential of that conductor. If a unit positive charge q is brought very near to the conductor from a point at infinity and if the amount of work done is W, the potential \u2018V\u2019 of the conductor or of that point\n\nW\n\nwill be, V=\n\n167\n\nElectric potential determines in which direction the flow of electric charge takes place when two charged conductors are electrically connected.\n\nIf two positively charged metallic spheres are connected by conducting wire (fig:10.12) then any of the following phenomena may occur. 1.

It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential.

The ammeter is connected in series to measure the electric current in a circuit.\n\nParallel circuit The circuit in which the electric components are arranged in such a way that one terminal of all the components are joined at a common point and the other terminal are joined at another common point then this circuit is called a parallel circuit.\n\nIn figure 11.10 one end of the bulbs B1 and B2 are connected at the point and the other end at the point b and so formed a parallel circuit.

Let I1 and I2 are the currents flowing through the bulbs B1 and B2 respectively. At the junction b the currents I1 and I2 recombine to form the current I again. If the current at the points P, Q and R is measured by an ammeter, then it will be found that\n\nI = I 1 + I 2\n\nHere, total current of the circuit i.e. in a parallel circuit, the sum of the individual currents flowing through each of the parallel branches is equal to the total current.\n\nThe electrical appliances such as- light, fan etc. which we use in houses or offices is connected in parallel to the AC mains. Each of the appliances gets the same voltage supply due to parallel connection. But they get different amounts of current.\n\n11.11 Equivalent resistance and its uses in circuit Sometimes several resistances are connected together for different purposes. Connection of more than one resistance together is called combination of resistances.\n\nEquivalent resistance: If a single resistance is used instead of combination of resistances and if the current and potential difference is not changed in the circuit, then that resistance is called the equivalent resistance of the combination. Combination of resistances is of two types, e.g. - series combination and parallel combination.\n\nSeries combination of resistances\n\nFigure shows resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in series.

Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\\n1. Damaged insulation\\n2. Overheating of the cables\\n3. Damped conditions\\n1. Damaged insulation:\\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.\\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.\\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual\\nlarge current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.\\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of\\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky.\\nSafe use of electricity\\nFigure: 11.14\\nIn the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. In the present section, we will learn about the safe uses of electricity.\\nWhen using electricity at home, the safety measures that are needed:\\n1. Circuit breaker\\n2. Fuses\\n3. Correct connection of switch\\n4. Earth wire\\n1. Circuit breaker\\nCircuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of a house. Circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply in a circuit when there is an overflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of the house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire.\\n2. Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent excessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the electric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit is disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher current than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If the fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.\\n3. Correct connection of switch: A switch breaks or completes an electrical circuit. During switch connection in a circuit, an important precaution is that the switch must be fitted onto the live wire. For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source from the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be 'live' even if the switch is 'off' [Figure 11.16] and increase the risk of electric shock.\\nFigure 11.15 and 11.16\\n4. Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a complete circuit. These are the live (L) and neutral (N) wire. The live wire delivers the electrical energy to the appliance. On the contrary, the current returns back to the supply through the neutral wire and complete the circuit. The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18.",

The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18.",

Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire. 3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of an electric switch by wet hand is risky. ) N\\ N\\ 7 (7 g R\n\nFigure: 11.14\n\nSafe use of electricity\n\nIn the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. In the\n\npresent section, we will learn about the safe uses of electricity.\n\nWhen using electricity at home, the safety measures that are needed:\n\n1. Circuit breaker\n\n2. Fuses\n\n3. Correct connection of switch\n\n4. Earth wire\n\n1. Circuit breaker Circuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of a house. Circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply in a circuit when there is an overflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of the house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire. 2. Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent excessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the electric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit is disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher current than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If the fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.",
            "192\n\nPhysics\n\nLoad shedding\n\nEach of the power stations generates a definite amount of electric power. The electricity generated by all the power stations is added in the national power grid. According to the demand of different locality power sub-stations collect electricity from the national grid. Then the power sub-station delivers or distributes the electricity to the consumer level. When in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the power sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in some parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. When the sub- station gets the supply according to its demand, then it distributes electricity in that region again. If the load shedding takes place for a couple of hours continuously, authority load sheds circularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level.\n\n11.14 Safe and effective use of electricity\n\nDangers of electricity Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\n\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\n\n1. Damaged insulation\n\n2. Overheating of the cables\n\n3. Damped conditions 1. Damaged insulation:\n\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber. These insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire. 2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual",

When the electrons move within the bulk of a conductor, they collide with the atoms and molecules of the conductor. Due to this their motion is resisted and electric current is obstructed. This property of a conductor is called resistance.\n\nAt particular temperature,\n\nR = V I Potential difference of two ends Electric current\n\nThe SI unit for resistance is ohm. It is expressed by the capital letter omega (\u2126). 1 \u2126 is the resistance of a conductor through which a current of 1A flows when a potential difference of 1 V is applied across it.\n\nResistors: A resistor is a conductor used in a circuit that has a known value of resistance. The main objective of using resistors is to control the quantity of the current flowing in a circuit. There are two types of resistors that are used in a circuit. These are:\n\n1. Fixed resistors\n\n2. Variable resistors 1. Fixed resistors: The fixed resistors are those who have fixed values of resistance.

The electromotive force of an electrical energy source is defined as the work done by the source or the energy spent by the source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit to the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source.\n\nIf the work done is W J in bringing Q C of charge in a complete circuit, then the work W\n\n\u2014 . Therefore the electromotive force of the source done in bringing 1 C of charge is\n\nQ\n\nis, E = W Q\n\nUnit: The SI unit of electromotive force is JC-1 or volt (V). The devices which can transform some other forms of energy into electrical energy they only have electromotive force. For example: cell, generator, etc. An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy and a generator coverts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell.\n\nPotential difference: The electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two terminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points. If W is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of charge, then the potential difference between the two points is",
            "186\n\nSay, the total current in the circuit is I which splits into two parts I1 and I2 at the junction a. Let I1 and I2 are the currents flowing through the bulbs B1 and B2 respectively. At the junction b the currents I1 and I2 recombine to form the current I again. If the current at the points P, Q and R is measured by an ammeter, then it will be found that\n\nI = I 1 + I 2\n\nHere, total current of the circuit i.e. in a parallel circuit, the sum of the individual currents flowing through each of the parallel branches is equal to the total current.\n\nThe electrical appliances such as- light, fan etc. which we use in houses or offices is connected in parallel to the AC mains. Each of the appliances gets the same voltage supply due to parallel connection. But they get different amounts of current.\n\n11.11 Equivalent resistance and its uses in circuit Sometimes several resistances are connected together for different purposes. Connection of more than one resistance together is called combination of resistances.\n\nEquivalent resistance: If a single resistance is used instead of combination of resistances and if the current and potential difference is not changed in the circuit, then that resistance is called the equivalent resistance of the combination. Combination of resistances is of two types, e.g. - series combination and parallel combination.\n\nSeries combination of resistances\n\nFigure shows resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in series. The resistances are connected one after another successively. In this case, the same current I is flowing through each of the resistors.

By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy.\n\n4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.

The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current. The arrow demonstrated in the diagram is indicating the direction of conventional current.

This flow of electron continues until the potential difference between the two bodies becomes zero. If by any process the potential difference between the two objects is maintained, then this flow of electron goes on continuously. This continuous flow of electrons is electric current.

In this case, the neutral point \u2018N\u2019 would not be nearer to the smaller charges.\n\n10.7 Electric Potential As there is intensity of an electric field, it also has electric potential. Potential determines the direction of motion of a charge in an electric field and also determines the direction in which the charge will flow when two charged conductors are connected by a conductor wire. If the charge creating field is positive, some work is done against the force of repulsion if another positive charge is brought near it. Therefore, the more positive charge is brought from a point at infinity nearer to the body, the more work will have to be done. So, within the electric field of a positively charged body, the more a point is brought nearer to the body, the more will be the quantity of potential. If any electric field created by a positively charged body and a free positive charge is placed and allowed to move freely, it would go away from the body. Therefore, we can say that positive charge moves from higher potential to lower potential. On the other hand, negative charge moves towards positively charged body. Thus, negative charge moves from lower potential to higher potential. If the body creating the electric field is charged negatively, then some work will be done due to attraction of a unit positive charge bringing towards it. A positive charge itself does work while coming from infinity towards a negatively charged body, which creates an electric field. As a result the charge loses energy and the potential at a point in the electric field is considered as negative. Measurement of potential: The work done to bring a unit positive charge from infinity to a point in an electric field is called the potential of that point. Again from infinity if a unit of positive charge is brought near to the conductor, the work done by the electric force or against the electric force is called potential of that conductor.

The ammeter is connected in series to measure the electric current in a circuit.\n\nParallel circuit The circuit in which the electric components are arranged in such a way that one terminal of all the components are joined at a common point and the other terminal are joined at another common point then this circuit is called a parallel circuit.\n\nIn figure 11.10 one end of the bulbs B1 and B2 are connected at the point and the other end at the point b and so formed a parallel circuit. In a parallel circuit there are alternative paths for the current to flow.\n\nQB\n\nFigure: 11.3",
            "186\n\nSay, the total current in the circuit is I which splits into two parts I1 and I2 at the junction a. Let I1 and I2 are the currents flowing through the bulbs B1 and B2 respectively. At the junction b the currents I1 and I2 recombine to form the current I again. If the current at the points P, Q and R is measured by an ammeter, then it will be found that\n\nI = I 1 + I 2\n\nHere, total current of the circuit i.e. in a parallel circuit, the sum of the individual currents flowing through each of the parallel branches is equal to the total current.\n\nThe electrical appliances such as- light, fan etc. which we use in houses or offices is connected in parallel to the AC mains. Each of the appliances gets the same voltage supply due to parallel connection. But they get different amounts of current.\n\n11.11 Equivalent resistance and its uses in circuit Sometimes several resistances are connected together for different purposes. Connection of more than one resistance together is called combination of resistances.\n\nEquivalent resistance: If a single resistance is used instead of combination of resistances and if the current and potential difference is not changed in the circuit, then that resistance is called the equivalent resistance of the combination. Combination of resistances is of two types, e.g. - series combination and parallel combination.\n\nSeries combination of resistances\n\nFigure shows resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in series. The resistances are connected one after another successively. In this case, the same current I is flowing through each of the resistors. Now we shall calculate the equivalent resistance of these three resistances those are connected in series.\n\n\u2014 V,\u2014 > 4\u2014 V,\u2014 > \u2014 V,\u2014 Ry R 2 R 3 ([\n\nFigure: 11.11 From Ohm\u2019s law we get,\n\nThe potential difference across resistance R1, 1\n\nThe potential difference across resistance R2,\n\nThe potential difference across resistance R3,\n\nIf V is the potential difference between the two terminals of all the resistors, i.e. the potential difference across the combination,\n\nV V V V = + + 1 2 3 IR IR + 2 + IR 3\n\nPhysics",

R n\n\nTherefore, the equivalent resistance of resistors connected is series is equal to the sum of the different resistances included in the combination. The value of the equivalent resistance in series combination is greater than that of individual resistances.\n\nParallel combination of resistances When several resistances are connected in such a way that one terminal of all the resistances are joined at a common point A and the other terminals are joined at another common point B and potential difference across each of the resistors remains the same, then this combination of resistances are called parallel combination of resistances.\n\n1 1\n\nFig. 11.12 Three resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in a parallel combination. In this case, same potential difference V is maintained across the two terminals of the three resistors. Different amount of current is flowing through each of the resistors owing to their different values. The main current I of the circuit splits into three parts at the junction a and later recombine at the point b. Let I1, I2 and I3 are the currents flowing through the resistances R1, R2 and R3 respectively. Therefore, sum of the currents I1, I2 and I3 of parallel paths is equal to the current I at the junction a.

The electricity thus generated has to be transmitted at different places according to the demand. The electrical energy produced is transmitted to the different substations situated at different places by the electricity transmission system. Then from different substations this electrical energy is distributed to the consumers by electricity distribution system again. In the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the i2R loss of the power grid becomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss.",

The coil in which an a.c or emf is induced is known as secondary coil. In step up transformer the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that in the primary coil. In step down transformer the number of turns in the secondary is less than that in the primary coil. 1 2| K [ ] ik\n\n\u2014 1 \u2014\u2014] i i Ep i i Es (I n it\n\nFigure: 12.12 a\n\nFigure: 12.12 b Let an a.c emf Ep be applicd to a primary coil np turns. A current Ip flows in this coil. This curent by magnetising the core produces magnetic lines of foorce that ultimately produces induced emf in the primary coil. If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associated with each turn of the sccondary coil. Consequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es = np ns\n\n12.1\n\nThat is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns.\n\nFor a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np. If no energy is dissipated in the transformer core, the energy input to the primary coil is wholly transferred to the secondary coil.\n\nTherefore, voltage of the primary coil x current of primary coil =\n\nVoltage of secondary coil x current of secondary coil\n\ni.c. Ep Ip = Es Is\n\nTherefore, Ep Es = Is Ip 12.2\n\nThis equation suggests that the rate at which a transformer reduces the voltage is exactly equal to the rate at which it increase the current so that the total power remains constant. Therefore, a transformer transforms both the voltage and the current.\n\nFor transmission of electric power over long distances step up transformer is used. Step down transformer is used for domestic power supply such as radio, television, tape recorder, VCR, VCP, electric watch etc.",

He invented calculus, a new branch of mathematics. The discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for Europe to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791- 1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiation was also discovered and produced in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through \u2033Morse code\u2033 to far off distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send energy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium. In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879- 1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford\u2019s (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr\u2019s (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics. The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom",

Radio, television, phone, fax, camera, computer, watch etc. are the contributions of electronics. The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison\u2019s effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconi\u2019s Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode. After two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, there was another electrode known as grid in it. Grid controls the flow of electric current from anode to cathode. It is wonderful that the triode can work as an amplifier. So triode plays a vital role in the development of communication.\n\n- W P\n\nFigures diode and triode As the size of diode and triode valves are very large, they create problem to fix them in different electronic devices. The expense of power for it is more, it is less reliable and cooling system is necessary to keep it cool. So the scientists were searching for a semiconductor device as its alternative. Later they invented p-n junction diode. After long experiments, they were able to invent n-p-n transistor. Transistor works as an amplifier.",

This magnet is used to remove the dust of iron from the eye. Besides, this magnet is also used as earpiece of telephone and lock of magnetic door. 12.5. Electromagnetic Induction Many scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested invented electromagnetic effect. Among the scientists who worked on this subject, Michael Faraday of England, Joseph Henry of America and H.F.E. Lenz of Russia achieved success individually. But at first Michael Faraday published the result of his experiments in 1831.He shows that a variable magnetic field can produce electromotive force which creats electric current through a closed circuit. The phenomena to produce electric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. Experiment-1: An insulated wire is wound over a card board cylinder in the form of a coil. Connect a galvanometer with two sides of this coil to understand the presence of electric current. You have to open the non conducting cover during the time of connection. Now insert the south pole of a magnet bar inside the coil. What\u2019s happening? Deflection of the galvanometer is taking place. It means the current is flowing through the Figure: 12.4 coil. Now remove the magnet. What\u2019s happening? The deflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to the coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet. If the coil is moved away from the magnet, we can see the deflection at the opposite side."

The coil in which an a.c or emf is induced is known as secondary coil. In step up transformer the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that in the primary coil.

If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associated with each turn of the sccondary coil. Consequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es = np ns\n\n12.1\n\nThat is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns.\n\nFor a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np.

You can do it yourself or with the help of your teacher. Put an electric wire between the two poles of a powerful magnet like the picture.

If you look at the picture 12.7(a), you will see the lines of force between the poles of the magnet. The magnetic field created by electric current has also been shown. The lines of force created from the combination of two fields has also been shown in the picture 12.7(b). The lines of force are more in the down than that of the up of the wire. The reason is that both the fields are working towards the same direction. [Again see the picture 12.7(a)].The fields above the wire are opposing each-other, some lines of force are rejecting one-another. As a result the number of lines is less there.

Here, the galvanometer is a device that can detect the existence of flow of current. It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current. The arrow demonstrated in the diagram is indicating the direction of conventional current.

The two slip rings can rotate to same orbit of armature. The two carbon brushes are set in such a way that they touch the two slip rings when the armature is being rotated.

As the two sides of the coil are connected to the external circuit a alternating current is develop in the circuit.

This is described in the chapter as the \"magnetic effect of current\". The magnetic field created by the current interacts with the magnetic field of a powerful magnet, resulting in a force that can cause the wire to move. This interaction is also known as electromagnetic induction.",

Effect of magnet on current carrying wire\n\nWe know that current carrying wire produced a magnetic field of its own. There happens action and reaction between magnetic field exsisting inside the opposite pole of a powerful magnet and the magnetic field of current carrying wire.\n\nYour teacher can show you the action and reaction. You can do it yourself or with the help of your teacher. Put an electric wire between the two poles of a powerful magnet like the picture. Let the electricity flow through\n\nFigure: 12.6\n\nthis wire. You will see that it will jump to the up. It is understood that a force is working on that. From where does this come? If you look at the picture 12.7(a), you will see the lines of force between the poles of the magnet. The magnetic field created by electric current has also been shown. The lines of force created from the combination of two fields has also been shown in the picture 12.7(b). The lines of force are more in the down than that of the up of the wire. The reason is that both the fields are working towards the same direction. [Again see the picture 12.7(a)].The fields above the wire are opposing each-other, some lines of force are rejecting one-another. As a result the number of lines is less there. As the line wants to keep themselves very tight to each other (like elastic rubber), they apply upward force on the wire. \u2014\u2014\u2014- -1 = 1 - \\ S .\n\nL 64. . \u2014~= R A, D ~\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFigure: 12.7 a\n\nFigure: 12.7 b\n\nIf the wire remains free, it moves upward.

Electric motor: Suppose a loop or coil of wire like picture 12.8(a) is used between the two poles of magnet .As the loop has returned to the opposite direction from A to B, the opposite electricity will flow between the two half of the loop or coil. So, the wire will go to the upward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical position of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. It consists of two",

We see that the needle is moving to one side after switching on the current on circuit. If we alter the electric connection, the needle of the compass will move the other side. From this effect, we can understand that a magnetic field is produced when a current flows through a wire.\n\n12.2.

Electromagnetic Induction Many scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested invented electromagnetic effect. Among the scientists who worked on this subject, Michael Faraday of England, Joseph Henry of America and H.F.E. Lenz of Russia achieved success individually. But at first Michael Faraday published the result of his experiments in 1831.He shows that a variable magnetic field can produce electromotive force which creats electric current through a closed circuit. The phenomena to produce electric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. Experiment-1: An insulated wire is wound over a card board cylinder in the form of a coil. Connect a galvanometer with two sides of this coil to understand the presence of electric current. You have to open the non conducting cover during the time of connection. Now insert the south pole of a magnet bar inside the coil. What\u2019s happening? Deflection of the galvanometer is taking place. It means the current is flowing through the Figure: 12.4 coil. Now remove the magnet. What\u2019s happening? The deflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to the coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet. If the coil is moved away from the magnet, we can see the deflection at the opposite side.",

If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es = np ns\n\n12.1\n\nThat is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns.\n\nFor a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np.

Therefore, a transformer transforms both the voltage and the current.\n\nFor transmission of electric power over long distances step up transformer is used. Step down transformer is used for domestic power supply such as radio, television, tape recorder, VCR, VCP, electric watch etc."

It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position. The galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates. 11.2 Direction of electric current and direction of electron flow When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential.

The lines of force created from the combination of two fields has also been shown in the picture 12.7(b). The lines of force are more in the down than that of the up of the wire. The reason is that both the fields are working towards the same direction. [Again see the picture 12.7(a)].The fields above the wire are opposing each-other, some lines of force are rejecting one-another. As a result the number of lines is less there.

Electromagnetic Induction Many scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested invented electromagnetic effect. Among the scientists who worked on this subject, Michael Faraday of England, Joseph Henry of America and H.F.E. Lenz of Russia achieved success individually. But at first Michael Faraday published the result of his experiments in 1831.He shows that a variable magnetic field can produce electromotive force which creats electric current through a closed circuit. The phenomena to produce electric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. Experiment-1: An insulated wire is wound over a card board cylinder in the form of a coil. Connect a galvanometer with two sides of this coil to understand the presence of electric current. You have to open the non conducting cover during the time of connection. Now insert the south pole of a magnet bar inside the coil. What\u2019s happening? Deflection of the galvanometer is taking place. It means the current is flowing through the Figure: 12.4 coil. Now remove the magnet. What\u2019s happening? The deflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to the coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet. If the coil is moved away from the magnet, we can see the deflection at the opposite side.",

        "answer": "Electromagnetic induction is the process by which a changing magnetic field induces an electric field in a conductor. This is achieved by the movement of a conductor within a magnetic field, causing a voltage to be induced in the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the rate of change of the magnetic field and the number of turns of the conductor.\n\nMathematically, the induced voltage (\u03b5) is given by:\n\n\u03b5 = -N(d\u03a6/dt)\n\nwhere N is the number of turns of the conductor, \u03a6 is the magnetic flux, and t is time.\n\nIn the context of a generator, electromagnetic induction is used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. When the armature of the generator rotates within the magnetic field, the magnetic flux through the armature coil changes, inducing a voltage in the coil. This voltage is then used to generate an electric current in the external circuit.\n\nThe function of a generator can be explained mathematically as:\n\nI = \u03b5/R\n\nwhere I is the current, \u03b5 is the induced voltage, and R is the resistance of the external circuit.\n\nIn the case of a step-up transformer, the voltage of the secondary coil is given by:\n\nV2 = V1 \u00d7 (N2/N1)\n\nwhere V1 is the voltage of the primary coil, N1 is the number of turns of the primary coil, N2 is the number of turns of the secondary coil, and V2 is the voltage of the secondary coil.\n\nGiven that the number of turns of the primary coil (N1) is 1000, the number of turns of the secondary coil (N2) is 50, and the voltage of the primary coil (V1) is 240V AC, the voltage of the secondary coil (V2) can be calculated as:\n\nV2 = 240 \u00d7 (50/1000) = 12V",

Electromagnetic Induction Many scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested invented electromagnetic effect.

The phenomena to produce electric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. Experiment-1: An insulated wire is wound over a card board cylinder in the form of a coil.

Now remove the magnet. What\u2019s happening? The deflection of galvanometer will be the opposite of that time when magnet was entered to the coil. If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet.

Galileo introduced the scientific trends of developing mathematical theory and verifying its authenticity through experiment. Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he discovered the laws of falling bodies and established the foundation of statics. Newton by his versatile genius discovered mechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of mathematics. The discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for Europe to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791- 1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiation was also discovered and produced in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through \u2033Morse code\u2033 to far off distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send energy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium. In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879- 1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford\u2019s (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr\u2019s (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics. The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom",

Radio, television, phone, fax, camera, computer, watch etc. are the contributions of electronics. The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison\u2019s effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconi\u2019s Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode. After two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, there was another electrode known as grid in it. Grid controls the flow of electric current from anode to cathode. It is wonderful that the triode can work as an amplifier. So triode plays a vital role in the development of communication.\n\n- W P\n\nFigures diode and triode As the size of diode and triode valves are very large, they create problem to fix them in different electronic devices. The expense of power for it is more, it is less reliable and cooling system is necessary to keep it cool. So the scientists were searching for a semiconductor device as its alternative. Later they invented p-n junction diode. After long experiments, they were able to invent n-p-n transistor. Transistor works as an amplifier."

        "answer": "Electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy through electromagnetic induction. When an electric current flows through the motor's coils, it generates a magnetic field. This magnetic field interacts with a permanent magnet or a magnetic field produced by another current, resulting in a torque that causes the motor's rotor to rotate. The rotation of the rotor is then transferred to the load, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy.",
        "referenceAnswer": "An electric motor utilizes the interaction between a magnetic field and a current-carrying conductor to produce rotational motion. A coil of wire carrying current is placed within a magnetic field. The interaction between the magnetic field and the current in the coil creates a force, causing the coil to rotate.  The rotation is made continuous by a commutator, which reverses the direction of current in the coil as it rotates, ensuring constant torque and rotation.",

So, the wire will go to the upward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical position of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. It consists of two\\nequal segments made of copper (see figure12.9). Each segment is connected to A and B respectively. The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric source through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when its' gap between two side remains opposite to the carbon brush, no current will flow. But despite this fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly when it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain continue.",

            "Physics\n\n81 We can understand from the electric power station that the way energy is transformed from one form to another and we get light and heat energy in our houses. By burning coal and natural gas in a power station, we can obtain chemical and heat energy. Heat energy is converted into mechanical energy with the help of turbine which rotates the coil of electric generator. In this process electrical energy is produced. Electric bulb and heater of houses and factories transform electrical into light and heat energy. Again, which energy is transformed into what type of energy when we pierce a nail into wood by hammering it? The chemical energy of our boy is used to lift the hammer upward which is stored as potential energy due to the higher position of it. When it moves down the potential energy stored is transformed into kinetic energy. This kinetic energy is used to pierce the nail into wood. At the same time sound energy and heat energy in nail, wood and in hammer is produced. During the transformation energy may not be created or destroyed but reduced. Such as, we cannot make use of all the heat energy as we can use light or electric energy.\n\n4.5 Power We all are familiar with the word power. In our daily life power is usually related to taking decision and implementation. In science the word \u201cpower\u201d is related to the devices motor, pump, and engine etc. i.e. any device that can work. Sometimes we want to solve any task quickly. Suppose we want to fill a water tank on the roof of a multistoried building taking water from its reservoir at the ground floor or from a pond. It takes a lot of time if we want to fill the tank carrying water with a bucket. It takes less time to fill the tank with the help of a motor or a pump. Sometimes a work is done quickly or slowly. Power is the measure of a source by which how fast or how slow a source can work is measured. Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time. Power =\n\nWork\n\nTime\n\nIf as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be,\n\nP =\n\nt\n\n(4.4)\n\nPower has no direction.

            "80\n\nPhysics\n\nTransformation of energy:\n\nWe have mentioned earlier about different forms of energy. All of them are related to one another. In other words, it is possible to transform one form of energy into another. This is known as transformation of energy. In fact, almost every natural phenomenon can be considered as a transformation of energy. Several examples of energy transformation are described below.\n\n1. Transformation of mechanical Energy: Rubbing of hands produces heat. In this case mechanical energy is converted into heat energy. If we low air in an empty pen cap, mechanical energy is converted into sound energy. When water is on a hill or a mountain, potential energy is stored in it. When this water flows down through a spring or river then the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. This flow of water can rotate a wheel to produce electricity. In this way mechanical energy can be transformed into electrical energy. 2. Transformation of heat Energy:\n\nIn steam engine heat is used to produce steam for driving train etc. Here heat energy is converted into mechanical energy. Heat energy is converted into light energy by conducting electric current through the filament of a bulb. If the junction of two different metallic substances is heated, the heat energy is converted into electric energy.\n\n3. Transformation of light energy: If we touch the chimney of a lantern we feel it to be hot. Here the light energy is converted into heat energy. Action of light on a photovoltaic cell converts light energy into electric energy. Due to the action of light on a photographic film light energy is transformed into chemical energy.\n\n4. Transformation of chemical energy: Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy. 5. Transformation of electrical energy:\n\nIn electric motor electric energy is transformed into mechanical energy. In instruments like heater, electric iron etc. electric energy is converted into heat energy. In electric bulbs electric energy is converted into light energy. The receiver of a telephone or radio converts electrical energy into sound energy. In a storage cell electric energy is converted into chemical energy. In electromagnets electric energy is converted into magnetic energy. 6. Transformation of Nuclear energy:\n\nIn nuclear submarine nuclear energy is transformed into mechanical energy. Devastating action of atom bomb is nothing but the transformation of nuclear energy. Nowadays, transformation of nuclear energy into other forms of energy especially electrical energy in a nuclear reactor mostly satisfies the demand of energy.",

The two slip rings can rotate to same orbit of armature. The two carbon brushes are set in such a way that they touch the two slip rings when the armature is being rotated. The resistance R of external circuit is connected to the brushes.\n\nFigure: 12.11 Functions: When the armature undergoes rotation, the armature coil intersect the lines of force of the magnetic field and the electromotive force is induced in the coil according to electromagnetic induction. As the two sides of the coil are connected to the external circuit a alternating current is develop in the circuit. The magnitude of induced current mainly depends on the intensity and speed of the rotation of the magnetic field. During one complete rotation of the coil the direction of the induced curent is changed once. Thus the alternating current is produced from the mechanical energy. 12.10.

A current Ip flows in this coil. This curent by magnetising the core produces magnetic lines of foorce that ultimately produces induced emf in the primary coil. If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associated with each turn of the sccondary coil. Consequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es = np ns\n\n12.1\n\nThat is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns.\n\nFor a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np.

We see that the needle is moving to one side after switching on the current on circuit. If we alter the electric connection, the needle of the compass will move the other side.

The coil in which an a.c or emf is induced is known as secondary coil. In step up transformer the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than that in the primary coil. In step down transformer the number of turns in the secondary is less than that in the primary coil. 1 2| K [ ] ik\n\n\u2014 1 \u2014\u2014] i i Ep i i Es (I n it\n\nFigure: 12.12 a\n\nFigure: 12.12 b Let an a.c emf Ep be applicd to a primary coil np turns. A current Ip flows in this coil. This curent by magnetising the core produces magnetic lines of foorce that ultimately produces induced emf in the primary coil. If there is no diminution of the magnctic lines same number of magnetic lines remain associated with each turn of the sccondary coil. Consequently an emf is induced in the secondary coil. If the number of turns in the secondary coil be ns and the induced emf be Es, We have: Ep Es = np ns\n\n12.1\n\nThat is to say that the induced emf in the coil is proportional to the number of turns.\n\nFor a step up transformer ns > np and for a step down transformer ns < np. If no energy is dissipated in the transformer core, the energy input to the primary coil is wholly transferred to the secondary coil.\n\nTherefore, voltage of the primary coil x current of primary coil =\n\nVoltage of secondary coil x current of secondary coil\n\ni.c. Ep Ip = Es Is\n\nTherefore, Ep Es = Is Ip 12.2\n\nThis equation suggests that the rate at which a transformer reduces the voltage is exactly equal to the rate at which it increase the current so that the total power remains constant. Therefore, a transformer transforms both the voltage and the current.\n\nFor transmission of electric power over long distances step up transformer is used. Step down transformer is used for domestic power supply such as radio, television, tape recorder, VCR, VCP, electric watch etc."

        "referenceAnswer": "An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy using the interaction between a magnetic field and a current-carrying conductor.  A coil of wire carrying current is placed within a magnetic field, and the interaction creates a force causing the coil to rotate. This rotation is continuous due to a commutator that reverses the current direction in the coil. Generators, on the other hand, do the opposite: they convert mechanical energy into electrical energy by rotating a coil within a magnetic field, inducing an electromotive force (EMF) that drives the flow of current.",
        "referenceContext": "Suppose a loop or coil of wire like picture 12.8(a) is used between the two poles of magnet .As the loop has returned to the opposite direction from A to B, the opposite electricity will flow between the two half of the loop or coil. So, the wire will go to the upward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical position of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. It consists of two\\nequal segments made of copper (see figure12.9). Each segment is connected to A and B respectively. The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric source through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when its' gap between two side remains opposite to the carbon brush, no current will flow. But despite this fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly when it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain continue.",

Electromagnetic Induction Many scientists tried to invent electric current from the magnetic field when Oerested invented electromagnetic effect. Among the scientists who worked on this subject, Michael Faraday of England, Joseph Henry of America and H.F.E. Lenz of Russia achieved success individually. But at first Michael Faraday published the result of his experiments in 1831.He shows that a variable magnetic field can produce electromotive force which creats electric current through a closed circuit. The phenomena to produce electric current in a closed circuit by variable magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. Faraday made two experiments to invent electromagnetic induction. You can also do the experiments. Experiment-1: An insulated wire is wound over a card board cylinder in the form of a coil. Connect a galvanometer with two sides of this coil to understand the presence of electric current. You have to open the non conducting cover during the time of connection. Now insert the south pole of a magnet bar inside the coil. What\u2019s happening? Deflection of the galvanometer is taking place. It means the current is flowing through the Figure: 12.4 coil.

If the magnet is kept stationary now, the galvanometer will show the deflections when the coil is moved towards or away from the magnet.

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

The total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an element is its mass number. For this reason, each isotope of an element has different mass number. Carbon can be considered as an example. Three isotopes of carbon 12 6C , 13 6C and 14 6C - the mass number of them are 12, 13, 14 respectively.

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller counter."

Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Analogue and Digital electronics Analogue signal: The magnitude of some quantity which changes continuously is called analogue. The magnitude of the quantities such as sound, light, temperature, pressure can be of any value within a definite extent. Analogue data is sent continuously. Telephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data. So the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or current is normally changed and can receive any value between the lowest and the highest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave.

The two slip rings can rotate to same orbit of armature. The two carbon brushes are set in such a way that they touch the two slip rings when the armature is being rotated. The resistance R of external circuit is connected to the brushes.\n\nFigure: 12.11 Functions: When the armature undergoes rotation, the armature coil intersect the lines of force of the magnetic field and the electromotive force is induced in the coil according to electromagnetic induction. As the two sides of the coil are connected to the external circuit a alternating current is develop in the circuit. The magnitude of induced current mainly depends on the intensity and speed of the rotation of the magnetic field. During one complete rotation of the coil the direction of the induced curent is changed once. Thus the alternating current is produced from the mechanical energy. 12.10.

As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

Here, the kinetic energy of electrons transforms into electromagnetic wave. This radiation of small wavelength is the X-ray.

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus.

Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom.

Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators.

The word \u2018digital\u2019 comes from the word digit. Digital signal means such a communicative signal which can receive some definite value. These can be changed into discrete values and each of them can be identified separately. In this system, with the help of binary code i.e. 0 and 1, any information, number, letter or any special signal etc. can be understood or sent. In this signal system, the value of \u2018on\u2019 state is 1 and the value of \u2018off\u2019 state is 0.

Analogue clock shows the time by continuous rotation of the hands and digital clock gives the time by changing the digits.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of analogue and digital signal Which one is better between analogue and digital signal can be measured by three factors. These are: the qualitative standard of the signal, the elements to maintain the process and cost or expense.",
            "214\n\nPhysics Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system. 13.8. Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

The receiver of fax machine receives the transmitted electronic signal through modem and converts it into original document by demodulating it. A printer prints out this document just as it is. Computer: This is the era of information and technology. The uses of computer are so excessive in every sphere of life including information technology and communication that this era is also called the era of computer. Most of the works of our daily life are being influenced by computer. Computer has become very essential in the field of science and technology.

Galileo introduced the scientific trends of developing mathematical theory and verifying its authenticity through experiment. Later, Newton (1642-1727 A.D) gave it a complete shape. Galileo defined displacement, motion, acceleration, time etc. and determined relations among them. Consequently he discovered the laws of falling bodies and established the foundation of statics. Newton by his versatile genius discovered mechanics and the three famous laws of mechanics and law of universal gravitation. He also made contribution for optics, heat and sound. He invented calculus, a new branch of mathematics. The discovery and inventions of the eighteenth and nineteenth century paved the way for Europe to industrial revolution. The steam engine of James Watt (1736-1819 A.D) played a vital role for industrial revolution. Hans Christian Oersted (1777-1851 A.D) demonstrated the magnetic effect of current. This discovery led Michael Faraday (1791- 1867 A.D), Henry (1797-1879 A.D) and Lenz (1804-1865 A.D) towards discovering the fact that magnetic effect produces electric current. In fact, this was a discovery of the process of converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. In 1864 James Clark Maxwell (1831-1879 A.D) demonstrated that light is one kind of electromagnetic wave. He established the electromagnetic theory by combining electric and magnetic field. Similar kind of radiation was also discovered and produced in 1888 by Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894 A.D). Using the same kind of waves in 1896, Marconi (1874-1937 A.D) discovered the method of sending signal through \u2033Morse code\u2033 to far off distance. Before him Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu (1858-1937 A.D) was able to send energy from one place to another through electromagnetic wave. In this way radio communication was developed. By the end of nineteenth century Roentgen (1845-1923 A.D) discovered x-rays and Becquerel (1852-1908 A.D) discovered the radio activity of uranium. In the twentieth century surprising advancement took place in the field of physics. Max Planck (1858-1947 A.D) discovered quantum theory of radiation. Albert Einstein (1879- 1955 A.D) invented theory of relativity. These two theories not only explained the previous experimental result but also made some predictions which were experimentally verified. Ernest Rutherford\u2019s (1871-1937 A.D) nuclear theory regarding atoms and Neill Bohr\u2019s (1885-1962 A.D) concept of electron layers in the hydrogen atoms were very important step of atomic physics. The next important discovery was made in 1938. At this time Otto Hann (1879-1968 A.D) and Stresemann (1902-1980 A.D) found out that nucleus was fissionable. Due to fission a nucleus of large mass number splits up into two nuclei of approximately equal mass number and a part of its mass is converted into energy as a result of which atom",

The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Although the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective of physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature. In the beginning of twentieth century physicist discovered that electrons revolves around",

Now the physicists have discovered that proton and neutron are formed of more smaller particles. The study of physics helps not only to understand and explain the natural events but also its application plays a vital role in other branches of science. At present physics is at the centre probably because of its application in other branches of science. The discovery of electron at the end of ninetieth century made possible to invent electron microscope which has brought about a revolution in material science and Cytology. In physics there is development of theories and application mathematics at the same time it has practical application and engineering application too. Physics is very essential to give fundamental explanation and form idea about Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy, Meteorology etc. In addition, there is wide application of methodology and instruments of physics in Biology, Oceanology, Psychology and Medical Science. Physics describes the laws of nature: The natural world that we live in follows some certain laws e.g. Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, law of conservation of energy etc. Since our childhood we have been acquiring these laws through our personal experiences which are very essential for our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature but can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about them. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation. Development of technology results from the proper application of fundamental laws of physics :\n\nWe have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how television works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth, , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using internet the whole world can be explored in a moment .

Physics instructs on how to think, show cause, how to put argument, how to utilize logic and mathematics. It stimulates our imagination and develops the power of thinking.\n\nPhysics teaches how to carry out observation:\n\nWe can develop our capability of observation.

Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma.

        "question": "How does a microphone convert sound into an electrical signal?",
        "answer": "A microphone converts sound into an electrical signal through electromagnetic induction. When sound waves hit the diaphragm of the microphone, it causes the diaphragm to vibrate. These vibrations create a magnetic field that induces an electromotive force (EMF) in the coil of the microphone, resulting in an electrical signal.",
        "referenceAnswer": "We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave.\\nThere is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, alternating electric current is induced in the moving coil. Thus microphone converts the sound energy into electrical energy. This is called audio signal.",

In 19th century, the development and expansion of telephone and telegraph has taken communication power of human one step forward. In 20th century radio, television, cell-phone, fax-machine have brought a revolution in the field of communication. After these, computer and internet have made great contribution to the development of communication. Radio: Radio is a wide and important medium of entertainment and communication. We can hear news, song, music, drama, discussion, debate and the advertisements of industrial products. Radio is used to exchange information in army and police department. Radio technology is used in the field of mobile or cellular phone communication.

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus.

In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation.",

Here p- type regions are the collector and emitter and n-type region is the base.\n\nTransistor is used to amplify the electric current. Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

The magnitude of the quantities such as sound, light, temperature, pressure can be of any value within a definite extent. Analogue data is sent continuously. Telephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data.\\nSo the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or current is normally changed and can receive any value between the lowest and the highest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave. Audio and video voltages are the example of analogue signals.\\nFigure 13.1: Analogue signal\\tFigure 13.2: Digital signal\\nDigital signal: Generally the word 'digit' means number. The word 'digital' comes from the word digit. Digital signal means such a communicative signal which can receive some definite value. These can be changed into discrete values and each of them can be identified separately. In this system, with the help of binary code i.e. 0 and 1, any information, number, letter or any special signal etc. can be understood or sent. In this signal system, the value of 'on' state is 1 and the value of 'off' state is 0.\\nFigure 13.3: transformation of analogue signal to a digital signal\\nComputer saves, process and sends any data as digital signal. With help of modem, analogue data can be changed into digital and digital data can be changed into analogue data. Analogue clock shows the time by continuous rotation of the hands and digital clock gives the time by changing the digits.\\nAdvantages and disadvantages of analogue and digital signal\\nWhich one is better between analogue and digital signal can be measured by three factors. These are: the qualitative standard of the signal, the elements to maintain the process and cost or expense.\\nDigital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second.

Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system. 13.8. Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

IC is such a creation using semiconductors like silicon, where millions of microscopic electric circuits are gathered in a place like a nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960.\n\n13.7. Analogue and Digital electronics Analogue signal: The magnitude of some quantity which changes continuously is called analogue. The magnitude of the quantities such as sound, light, temperature, pressure can be of any value within a definite extent. Analogue data is sent continuously. Telephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data. So the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or current is normally changed and can receive any value between the lowest and the highest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave.

Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation.",
            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller counter.",

Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller counter.",

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect.

Here p- type regions are the collector and emitter and n-type region is the base.\n\nTransistor is used to amplify the electric current. Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",
            "212\n\nPhysics\n\n13.6: Development of electronics The present era is the era of electronics. Radio, television, phone, fax, camera, computer, watch etc. are the contributions of electronics. The control of electric current through vacuum tube, special type of crystals and chips is known as electronics. The history of electronics is ancient of more than hundred years. The real journey of electronics begins with the invention of Addison\u2019s effect in 1883. When Addison was working with electric lamp, one thing was disturbing him highly. The positive end of the filament of carbon of the lamp was burning again and again. To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positive plate, so this charge is negative. If the plate is negative, it repels the emitted charge, as a result no current flows through the circuit. This is known as Addison effect. British physicist Fleming first invented the vacuum tube by using Addison effect. This tube works as a rectifier that means it changes alternating current to direct current. This is the real beginning of electronics. During this time, detector was very necessary for Marconi\u2019s Radio. This tube fills up the need of the detector. As there were two electrodes in it, this is called diode. After two years, an American named Lee de Forest invented another vacuum tube called triode. Since it had three electrodes, it was named as triode. Besides anode and cathode, there was another electrode known as grid in it. Grid controls the flow of electric current from anode to cathode. It is wonderful that the triode can work as an amplifier. So triode plays a vital role in the development of communication.\n\n- W P\n\nFigures diode and triode As the size of diode and triode valves are very large, they create problem to fix them in different electronic devices. The expense of power for it is more, it is less reliable and cooling system is necessary to keep it cool. So the scientists were searching for a semiconductor device as its alternative. Later they invented p-n junction diode. After long experiments, they were able to invent n-p-n transistor. Transistor works as an amplifier."

Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence.

In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation.",

Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators.

Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system. 13.8. Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue.

The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation.

        "answer": "The development of electronics began with Addison's effect in 1883, where British physicist J.J. Thomson discovered that a positive potential applied to a plate with respect to a filament in a vacuum tube causes an electric current to flow. This led to the invention of the vacuum tube by British physicist J.L. Fleming, which worked as a rectifier, changing alternating current to direct current.\n\nLater, American inventor Lee de Forest invented the triode, a vacuum tube with three electrodes, including a grid that controlled the flow of electric current. The triode played a vital role in the development of communication, as it could work as an amplifier.\n\nHowever, the size and expense of vacuum tubes created problems for their use in electronic devices. In response, scientists searched for a semiconductor device as an alternative.

Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on.

In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

            "214\n\nPhysics Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system. 13.8. Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus.

In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation.",

Here p- type regions are the collector and emitter and n-type region is the base.\n\nTransistor is used to amplify the electric current. Integrated circuit: Integrated circuit is commonly known as IC. IC is used in most of the electronic appliances starting from computer, mobile phone to microoven which we see around us. IC is such a creation using semiconductor like silicon where millions of microscopic electronic circuits are gathered in a place like the nail of our finger. Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed.

In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Semiconductor and Integrated Circuit Semiconductor: There are some materials (such as- silicon and germanium) which are neither good conductor nor insulator. These are called semiconductors. Pure semiconductor works as an insulator when it is cold. At normal room temperature it behaves slightly as a conductor. But the conductivity of semiconductor can be increased by adding some definite elements with it. Semiconductor is divided into n-type and p- type on the basis of the elements added to it. Negative and positive charge carriers are denoted by n-type and p-type respectively. The semiconductor made by the addition of phosphorous with silicon is an example of n-type material. The presence of phosphorous atoms increases the number of negatively charged electrons which can move freely in the substance. The semiconductor made by the addition of boron with silicon is the example of p-type material. The boron atoms create gap or positive holes in the electronic structure of atom. The electrons move from one hole to another by jumping within the material. If an n-type material is sandwiched with a p-type material, a very necessary device is developed which is called a p-n junction diode. It works as a rectifier. Diode makes the electric current unidirectional i.e. the diode transforms the alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC). It saves radio, TV, computer etc. to be electrified due to faulty connection.\n\n* \\ 4|<]7\n\nFigure 13.4: Diode and its symbol It is necessary to amplify the electric current and voltage for various reasons. The instrument which performs this work is called an amplifier. Transistor is such a device which works as an amplifier and high speed switch. A transistor is made when a p-type substance is introduced between two n-type materials like a sandwich. These three layers are called collector, base and emitter. The two n-type regions are the emitter and collector and the narrow p-type region is the base of the Fig: 13.5: Transistor and its symbol",

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation."

In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation. So the people who work with radioactive radiation should be careful. They should take proper steps to protect themselves from the excessive radioactive radiation.",
            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller counter.",

The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators.

Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system.

The frequency or power of this signal is very weak and its frequency range is 20 hertz to 20000 hertz. This wave cannot go far. So this information carrying low frequency wave is mixed with high frequency electromagnetic wave. This high frequency electromagnetic wave is called carrier wave. This combined wave is called modulated wave. The process of mixing these two waves is called modulation. This modulated wave is also called radio wave. Radio wave is amplified with the help of an amplifier and transmitted to space as electromagnetic wave with the help of antenna of the transmitter. This radio wave spreads out in the space and it is divided into two waves called Ground wave and Sky wave. Ground wave directly reaches to the aerial of receiver.

Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms.

It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases.

The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation.

Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma. As a result they transform into lighter elements by the process of disintegration. As the Radium metal transforms into Lead step by step through radioactive disintegration. The unit which is used to measure radioactivity is named Becquerel. 13.2. Properties of alpha, beta and gamma rays Alpha particle: Alpha particle is a Helium nucleus. There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen. The velocity of it is 10% of the velocity of light. Beta particle: These particles are negatively charged and largely deflected by magnetic and electric field. The speed of it is 50% of the speed of light but it can be increased up to 98%. Its mass is the same as that of electron i.e. 9.11\u00d710-31kg. Its existence can be detected by photographic film and cloud chamber. These particles can produce fluorescence. Their penetrating power is more than that of the Alpha particles. The motion of these particles can be stopped by a 3mm thick aluminum sheet. Beta particles can produce enough ionization in a gas. Gamma rays: These rays are charge neutral. This is an electromagnetic wave. It is of short wavelength. It has no mass. It is not deflected by electric and magnetic field. Its speed is same to that of light, which means 3\u00d7108 ms-1. Its penetrating power is very high. It can pass through a lead sheet having a few centimeter thickness. Though its ionizing power is less, it can produce fluorescence. Its presence can be identified by photographic film, cloud chamber and Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller counter.",

Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators. Therefore, the materials where electrons are not free to move about are the"

            "214\n\nPhysics Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system.

The frequency or power of this signal is very weak and its frequency range is 20 hertz to 20000 hertz. This wave cannot go far. So this information carrying low frequency wave is mixed with high frequency electromagnetic wave. This high frequency electromagnetic wave is called carrier wave. This combined wave is called modulated wave. The process of mixing these two waves is called modulation. This modulated wave is also called radio wave. Radio wave is amplified with the help of an amplifier and transmitted to space as electromagnetic wave with the help of antenna of the transmitter. This radio wave spreads out in the space and it is divided into two waves called Ground wave and Sky wave. Ground wave directly reaches to the aerial of receiver. The radio set in our house is a radio wave receiver. The sky wave comes back to the earth by being reflected at the ionosphere and is received by Ariel of the receiver. The receiver receives the radio wave and converts into electrical signal. After that the sound wave is separated from the carrier wave by the process of demodulation. Later electrical signal is amplified with the help of amplifier and is sent to loudspeaker. Loudspeaker again changes the electrical signal into sound. We can hear this sound. So, the sound is not transmitted from the transmitter to the radio. The sound wave is sent by changing it into electromagnetic wave, the receiver receives the radio wave, the loudspeaker changes it into sound.\n\nransmitter receiver ransitting aeia Teceiving aeral mictophone : A juned === 0 requency @ S R Toudspeaker \u2122 earth \u2014 - S\n\nTelevision: Television is such a device by which we can hear the sound and watch the picture of the speakers on the screen from distant place.

This signal is mixed with a high frequency carrier in the modulation process. Afterwards it is sent in the form of electromagnetic radio wave with the help of an antenna. TV set receives electromagnetic carrier wave for the picture with the help of antenna. Rectifier separates video electrical signal from the carrier wave. This electrical signal is amplified by an amplifier and it is sent to the electron gun. This electron gun is attached to the back of the picture tube of the television. After receiving the video signal, the electron gun shoots the narrow electron beam like a needle. When the electron beam from the electron gun incidents on the fluorescent phosphor screen of the TV, then flash of light is created. With the combination of these bright and dark spots, bright and dark light spots and flashes are created on the TV screen. The picture sent from the camera is seen on the TV screen with the combination of these bright and dark spots. This forms 25 still picture on the TV screen in every second which our eyes see as moving picture.

            "210\n\nPhysics\n\n13.1. Radioactivity In 1896, French scientist Henry Becquerel observes that a radiation with special penetrating power emits spontaneously from the nucleus of Uranium metal in a continuous manner. He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase or decrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays.

There are two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus. The penetrating power of alpha particle is less; it cannot pass through 6 cm thick air. These particles are influenced by both the magnetic and electric field. These particles can create intense ionization and are very harmful and dangerous. The mass of this particle is four times than that of the Hydrogen atom and its charge is 3.2\u00d710-19 C. Its presence can be detected by photographic films, cloud chamber and gold leaf electroscope. These particles create florescence on zinc sulphide screen.

But we can calculate how many atoms will decay in a particular time. A cluster of atoms is considered to study the decay of atoms. The time during which just half of the total number of radioactive atoms undergoes disintegration is called the half-life of that element. As for example, let us assume that there are 800000 atoms in a radioactive element. The time required for the decay of its half i.e. 400000 atoms to transform into a new element is known as its half-life. After a next half-life, there remains 200000 numbers of atoms. After another half-life, the number of atoms will be 100000 and thus it will continue. Here a law of possibility works, which atom will disintegrate when, none can say it. 13.4: Uses of radioactivity There are a lot of uses of radioactivity in medical science, agriculture and industries. In medical science especially to treat incurable cancer, the uses of radioactivity are frequent now-a-days. In medical science, the radioactive isotopes are used as radioactive tracers to diagnose different diseases like blockage of kidney, thyroid problems etc. In agriculture, radioactive tracers are being successfully used, especially to develop high yielding variety of seeds and in the research to produce special type of fertilizer necessary for trees. The radioactivity is also widely used in industries. To make the equipment germless, to control the thickness of paper in the paper mill, to identify the presence of smoke in the fire, to verify the welding of metals, the radioactivity is being successfully used. It is also used to measure the quantity of different elements in the minerals. Even the radioactive tracers are being used successfully to diagnose diseases. The hands and number of many watches are seen glittering even in the dark. This happens because the hands and the numbers in the watches are covered with a mixture of radioactive thorium and zinc sulfide, as a result they glitter. Radioactivity is also used to determine the age or time of things of millions year old. 13.5: Dangers of radioactivity: Although radioactivity is beneficial to us, it can be very dangerous also. The high dose of radioactive radiation can create serious problems in human body. Life killer cancer may cause from this radiation. The preventive power against disease is reduced if someone keeps oneself in close-contact with excessive radioactive radiation for a long time. Man can be mentally disabled; even he may be physically invalid. The harmful effect of radioactivity can be observed from generation to generation.

Revolutionary changes took place in the design of IC chips after its invention in 1960. At the early stage, there were hundreds of circuits or components organized in the IC chips. The number reaches to thousands by 1970. At that time IC was used only in computers and pocket calculators. At present, a single IC chip can contain millions of components which are able to operate or drive many complex devices or machines. The famous Intel chip is an example of it. The interesting matter is that as the number of components is increasing, the size of the chips is getting smaller and the standard of the devices is being developed. If the IC chips were not invented and developed, we would not get creative devices like mobile phone, internet, MP-3 player and so on. The modern IC chips have brought a revolution and given us many facilities and comforts.\n\n13.9. Microphone and Speaker Microphone is orally known as mike. In a big meeting or program, a speaker delivers his speech in front of an electronic device which is known as microphone or mike. Microphone converts sound into an electric signal. The audience can hear it loudly through a loud speaker. Because the speaker transforms the electric signal of microphone into sound. Perhaps you will have seen the use of microphone and speaker in various ceremonies of your school. Both microphones and speakers are found in tape-recorder, VCR etc. Microphone and its functions We have already said that microphone is such a device that changes sound wave into electrical audio wave or signal. The frequency and relative amplitude of the electrical audio signal remain the same as that of the sound wave. There is a moving coil and a thin metallic sheet named diaphragm in the microphone. When a person speaks through a microphone, the diaphragm vibrates by the sound wave. Diaphragm is that part of the microphone which is designed to transform the vibration of sound into electricity. The vibration of different types of sounds vibrates the diaphragm differently. This vibration makes the diaphragm move to and fro in the magnetic field. As a result, Fig: 13.6 Microphone",

Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic. 3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors. For example- germanium, silicon etc. The current conduction capacity of semiconductor can be increased by adding suitable impurities.\n\n11.5 Relationship between potential difference and electric current- Ohm\u2019s law We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm\u2019s law.\n\nOhm\u2019s law The current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\n\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third. Assume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA > VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\n\nFigure: 11.3\n\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm\u2019s law,\n\nY v X\n\n[V\n\nV\n\n= = constant\n\nR\n\n\u21d2\n\nI\n\nThis constant is called the resistance of the conductor at that temperature.\n\nFig: 11.14\n\nor, I = V R Graph of V-I is shown in fig. 11.4",

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor. 1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors. 2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators.

            "214\n\nPhysics Digital signal is the best to send a signal to a long distance. If the distance is long, the power of analogue signal decreases gradually. Then to sustain the analogue signal, amplification has to be done. As a result noise increases, and the quality of the signal is reduced or distorted and it can be fully lost. But the digital signal is amplified on the way. As a result the signal remains unchanged. Digital signal is used to transmit a signal through an optical fiber, since the qualitative standard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system. 13.8.

The frequency or power of this signal is very weak and its frequency range is 20 hertz to 20000 hertz. This wave cannot go far. So this information carrying low frequency wave is mixed with high frequency electromagnetic wave. This high frequency electromagnetic wave is called carrier wave. This combined wave is called modulated wave. The process of mixing these two waves is called modulation. This modulated wave is also called radio wave. Radio wave is amplified with the help of an amplifier and transmitted to space as electromagnetic wave with the help of antenna of the transmitter. This radio wave spreads out in the space and it is divided into two waves called Ground wave and Sky wave. Ground wave directly reaches to the aerial of receiver. The radio set in our house is a radio wave receiver. The sky wave comes back to the earth by being reflected at the ionosphere and is received by Ariel of the receiver. The receiver receives the radio wave and converts into electrical signal. After that the sound wave is separated from the carrier wave by the process of demodulation. Later electrical signal is amplified with the help of amplifier and is sent to loudspeaker. Loudspeaker again changes the electrical signal into sound. We can hear this sound.

Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active. Human body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into",

The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Although the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective of physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature.

        "answer": "The human body is similar to a machine in that it can perform complex functions with precision and efficiency, and it can be analyzed and understood using the principles of physics. The human body is made up of billions of cells, which work together to maintain various bodily functions, such as movement, digestion, and respiration. This complexity is similar to the internal workings of a machine, where various components work together to achieve a specific function.\n\nHowever, the human body is different from a machine in that it is a living, dynamic system that is capable of growth, adaptation, and self-repair. Unlike machines, which are typically designed to perform a specific function and then stop, the human body is constantly changing and evolving to meet the needs of the individual. Additionally, the human body is capable of complex behaviors and emotions, which are not typically found in machines.\n\nIn terms of physical laws, the human body can be understood using the principles of physics, such as the laws of motion, energy, and thermodynamics. For example, the movement of the human body can be explained by the laws of mechanics, while the functioning of the human heart can be explained by the laws of thermodynamics.

Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly. It is impossible for a doctor to identify a disease without the right instrument, which is necessary to perform that particular test. The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of different devices. Once people used to believe different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

Bose\u2019s education started at a vernacular school in Faridpur. Next he got admitted to Hare school and Saint Xavier\u2019s school and college in Kolkata and passed his student life. After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the year 1880. His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research.

            "2\n\n1.1 Physics\n\nThe branch of science which deals with matter and energy is called physics. The main objectives of physics are to establish the relation between matter and energy and to express it quantitatively on the basis of observation, experimentation and analysis.\n\nScope of Physics : Physics is the key of all science. It is the fundamental branch of science because the foundation of other subjects is based on the principles of physics. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a basic principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Starting from Engineering to Medical Science, Astronomy to Oceanology, Biology to Psychology the instruments of Physics are used. For the systematic study of physics, we can divide it into the following branches : (1) Mechanics (2) Heat and thermodynamics (3) Sound (4) Optics (5) Electricity and Magnetism (6) Solid State Physics (7) Atomic Physics (8) Nuclear Physics (9) Quantum Physics and (10) Electronics\n\nDevelopment of physics: Modern civilization is the product of science. Behind this development of science there are untiring efforts, discoveries and innovation of scientists. Science has no national or political boundaries. The growth, development and benefit of science are enjoyed by all people of all nations. From ancient time scientist have been contributing for the development of science. In this lesson we will try to mention the contributions of physicists. Thales (624-569 B.C) is famous for his predictions regarding solar eclipse. He also knew about the magnetic properties of loadstone. Pythagoras (527-497 B.C) is a memorable name in the history of science. Beside the invention of several Geometric theorem, he made longer lasting contribution through his works on vibrating string. He was given several Geometric theorem .Moreover, he made long lasting contributions through his works on vibrating strings. The present scales of musical instruments and music are partially the contributions of his research on the vibration of strings. Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 B.C) gave the idea that the matter consists of indivisible units. He called it atom. His concept about atom was significant even though it is completely different from the present concept. Greek scientist Archimedes (287-212 B.C) discovered the principles of lever and the law of upward force acting on bodies immersed in liquid and was able to determine the impurity in metals. He also knew the technique of setting fire by concentrating sun rays with the help of spherical mirrors. After Archimedes, scientific discoveries advanced rather slowly for a few centuries.

Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active. Human body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into",

The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science.

The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active. Human body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into",
            "Physics\n\n5 bomb and nuclear reactor are invented. The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Although the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective of physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature. In the beginning of twentieth century physicist discovered that electrons revolves around",

Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly.

In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the year 1880. His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research.

Physics describes the laws of nature: The natural world that we live in follows some certain laws e.g. Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, law of conservation of energy etc. Since our childhood we have been acquiring these laws through our personal experiences which are very essential for our life. We cannot change the function and laws of nature but can utilize them. For their proper utilization we need sufficient knowledge about them. Moreover physics is the science that studies on this earth for innovation. Development of technology results from the proper application of fundamental laws of physics :\n\nWe have to have knowledge about the fundamental laws of physics if want to know how television works, rocket flies in the space, artificial satellite revolves around the earth, , mobile phone functions, submarine remain submerged into water and how by using internet the whole world can be explored in a moment . The discovered laws of physics pave the way to invent these technologies. Study of physics is a perfect human training :\n\nWe can achieve new idea by the study of physics. Physics instructs on how to think, show cause, how to put argument, how to utilize logic and mathematics. It stimulates our imagination and develops the power of thinking.\n\nPhysics teaches how to carry out observation:\n\nWe can develop our capability of observation. We can also learn how to carry out systematic observations by studying physics properly"

        "referenceContext": "14.2 Contributions of Jagadish Chandra Bose\\nAcharya Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was a physicist as well as a biologist. In our sub- continent he is the first internationally recognized scientist. Bose family hailed from the village Rarikhal of Bikrampur under district of Dhaka. He was born in Mymensingh on 30th November, 1958. His father Bhagawan Chandra Bose was a deputy magistrate in the district of Faridpur. Bose's education started at a vernacular school in Faridpur. Next he got admitted to Hare school and Saint Xavier's school and college in Kolkata and passed his student life. After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the year 1880. His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research. He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated\\n\\nwave to millimeter level (about 5 mm). He was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio signal.

Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active. Human body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into",

The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Although the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective of physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature.

        "question": "Explain how the human body can be viewed as a machine, but also discuss the limitations of this analogy.",
        "answer": "Human body can be viewed as a machine due to its ability to perform complex functions with precision and efficiency. The body's cells, tissues, and organs work together to maintain homeostasis, regulate various bodily functions, and respond to external stimuli. This can be compared to a machine, where individual components work together to achieve a common goal.\n\nHowever, there are limitations to this analogy. The human body is a complex, dynamic system that is influenced by numerous factors, including genetics, environment, and emotions. This complexity cannot be fully captured by a machine analogy, as machines lack the ability to adapt, learn, and respond to changing conditions.\n\nMoreover, the human body is not a passive machine, but an active, self-regulating system that can modify its behavior in response to internal and external stimuli. This self-regulation is not easily replicable in machines, which are typically designed to follow predetermined instructions.\n\nDespite these limitations, the machine analogy can be useful for understanding certain aspects of human physiology and behavior. For example, it can help explain how the body's systems work together to maintain overall health and function. However, it should not be taken too far, as it can oversimplify the complexities of human biology and behavior.",

Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly. It is impossible for a doctor to identify a disease without the right instrument, which is necessary to perform that particular test. The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of different devices. Once people used to believe different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",
            "228\n\nPhysics\n\n14.1 Basis of bio-physics Bio-physics is such a branch of science which is developed on the basis of a number of branches of science. Theories and methods of physical science are employed in biophysics to study a system of biology. Biology is the science of studying living world. How plants and animals collect food, communicate, percept from the environment and reproduce are discussed in biology. On the other hand the mathematical rule which nature follows is the subject-matter of physics. For a long period, the scientists believed that the laws of living world and physical world are different. But with the progress of physical and biological science, a deep harmony is found between these two apparently different disciplines. At first physics and biology has evolved as two different subjects. The mutual relationship and coordination between these two subjects has increased a lot with the advancement of science. It was thought before that living world follows a different rule and the laws of physical science are applicable only for the inanimate objects. But now we know that the animal body can be compared to a machine from many aspects and it is possible to explain many behaviors of animal body with the help of physical laws. Actually, the laws of physics are universal. So, not only the physical world, but also the animal kingdom can be explained with the help of physics in many cases. This is the basis of bio-physics. The challenge of bio-physics is to explain different complexities of life on the basis of simple laws of physics. Bio-physics is a powerful tool to reach at the depth of life by investigating different secrets of life and analyzing different events using mathematics and physics. Bio-physics is a bridge between biology and physics.\n\n14.2 Contributions of Jagadish Chandra Bose Acharya Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was a physicist as well as a biologist.

Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active. Human body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work.

The amount of energy we are getting at present from the nucleus is huge compared to the energy obtained from all the sources in the past. Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science. For example, the principle of conservation of energy is a principle of physics used to explain the wide range of science starting from the structure of atom to weather forecasting. Although the main function of physics is to study matter and energy, the main objective of physics is to realize the rules of nature as well as unearthing the mystery of nature.

The human body is made up of billions of cells, which work together to maintain various bodily functions, such as movement, digestion, and respiration. This complexity is similar to the internal workings of a machine, where various components work together to achieve a specific function.\n\nHowever, there are key differences between the human body and a machine. The human body is a living, dynamic system that is capable of growth, repair, and adaptation, whereas a machine is an inanimate object that is designed to perform a specific function. Additionally, the human body is subject to various external factors, such as temperature, humidity, and stress, which can affect its functioning, whereas a machine is typically designed to operate in a controlled environment.\n\nIn terms of the human body's ability to perform complex functions, it is often compared to a machine in that it can:\n\n* Develop from a single cell into a complex organism\n* Maintain homeostasis and regulate various bodily functions\n* Respond to external stimuli and adapt to changing conditions\n* Perform complex tasks, such as movement and cognition\n\nHowever, the human body also has unique characteristics that distinguish it from a machine, such as:\n\n* Its ability to grow and develop throughout life\n* Its capacity for self-repair and regeneration\n* Its sensitivity to external factors, such as temperature and stress\n* Its ability to experience emotions and consciousness\n\nOverall, while the human body shares some similarities with machines, it is a unique and complex living system that is capable of growth, adaptation, and self-regulation.",

Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly. It is impossible for a doctor to identify a disease without the right instrument, which is necessary to perform that particular test. The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of different devices. Once people used to believe different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs. Each organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines. Heart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active. Human body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work.

Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science. Outstanding contribution of physics in the field of medical science lies in inventing different instrument along with radio isotope for the prevention of diseases. Another advancement of physics in the twentieth century is the exploration in the space.\n\n1.2 Objectives of Physics : Physics unearths the mystery of nature: Physics is the fundamental branch of science because its principles are the basis of other branches of science.

        "referenceContext": "14.3 Human body and machine\\nWe use different types of devices to meet our various needs of everyday life such as- automobiles, refrigerator, television, steam engine, internal combustion engine etc. Many people designated human body as a machine. Though human body is not a machine at all, it behaves as a machine in many aspects. As like as a machine, it is also made up of many small parts or organs, absence or infirmity of one organ the activities of the whole body is disturbed. Each part of the body, like each part of a machine, does special jobs.\\nEach organ of human body is interconnected with other organs, each organ runs at its own individual speed, but all function in a specific way and there is a predetermined relationship to each other. In this sense, the human body is analogous to the most complicated man-made machines.\\nHeart, kidneys, lungs, liver etc. are such parts of human body. As for example- heart is actually an automatic pump, which is able to circulate blood throughout the whole body by its own electric signal without any external stimulation. On the contrary, kidney is a special filtration machine which eliminates the nitrogenated waste materials of the body. Due to the coordination of functions of such small machines the whole human body remains active.\\nHuman body is like an organic machine. Energy is needed in a machine to do work. In different engines using fuels like petrol, diesel, CNG etc. we convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. Similarly, human body also transforms chemical energy into\\n\\nmechanical and heat energy by food ingestion and respiration. Therefore, human body is like an organic machine in fact. But, in many aspects, human body is more amazing than the most complex machine made by humans. Human body can perform such functions which is not possible for any machine.

Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly.

The specific cause for a particular disease became known to us due to the invention of different devices. Once people used to believe different superstitions related to disease due to ignorance. In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",

Day by day nuclear energy is becoming the principal source of energy. In this century quantum theory of the relativity etc. was developed in the field of theoretical physics. Satyendranath Basu (1894-1974 A.D) professor of physics, University of Dhaka made important contribution on theoretical physics. He demonstrated a comparatively correct form of Planck\u2019s quantum theory. His theory is known as Bose-Einstein\u2019s statistics. As recognition of his contribution one kind of elementary particle is named after him and is called Boson. Three nobel laureate physicist Prof. Abdus Salam (1926- 1996 A.D) of Pakistan, Sheldon Glasso (1932-) and Stevan Wienberg (1933-) of United States made outstanding contribution by discovering weak electric force in unifying the elementary particles in unified field theory. Prior to that nobel laureate physicist Chandra Shekhar Ramon (1888-1970 A.D) discovered Ramon effect. Physics has made significant contribution in the progress of medical science in twentieth century. By using radio isotopes along with the discovery of numerous equipments physics has contributed to medical science. Another advancement of physics in twentieth century is exploration in the space. The contribution of physics lies in landing human footprint on the moon along with the staying of months after months in space station and exploration on the Mars. Artificial satellite has contributed to forecast weather and made communication easy. Moreover electronics has already brought about revolution in our daily life and changed our life style. Now a days radio, television, digital camera, mobile phone, i-pad and computer are used almost in every house. Various electronics instruments have developed human\u2019s work ability to a great extent. In nineteenth century physics played a vital role for the advancement of medical science.

Modern instruments to identify diseases were not invented at that time. As a result, it was not possible to locate the exact positions of different organs. In addition, in which degree a particular organ of the patient is infected was not possible to know. Various types of instruments are invented utilizing different technologies of science to diagnose diseases. With the help of these instruments it became possible to determine diseases properly.

In the modern society, the mortality rate is decreased by a large amount. The principal reason behind this is that physical instruments are being used for the purpose of diagnosis and treatment. In this section, some of the instruments which are generally used for diagnosis of diseases are discussed.\n\nX-ray X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray is invisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result, the electrons are freed and come out. If a high potential difference is applied between the electrodes, the electrons are accelerated with Physics",
