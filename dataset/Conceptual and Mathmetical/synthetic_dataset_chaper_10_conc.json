        "referenceContext": "We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically neutral that is it has no charge. The amount of charge in a proton is equal to the charge of an electron. Naturally an atom has an equal number of protons and electrons. As a result in the atom whole atom there is no electrical property to be detected. The number of electrons and protons in different matters is different."

Again when a rod of ebonite or polythene is rubbed with flannel, polythene rod gets charged negatively and the flannel becomes positively charged. Because polythene has more affinity for electrons than that of flannel and so when they are rubbed together free electrons of flannel moves to ebonite or polythene and gets charged negatively [Fig 10.3]."

        "question": "What is an electroscope, and how is it used to detect the presence of a charge and determine its polarity?",
        "referenceAnswer": "The instrument which detects the presence and nature of charge in any body is called electroscope. A metallic circular disk is fixed on the top of brass or any metallic rod R [Fig: 10.7] and at lower end of the rod two light leaves of gold are attached. Instead of gold aluminium or any other light metal can also be used. The lower end of the rod with the leaves is placed in a glass jar passing through a cork of nonconductor matter C. As the apparatus is kept inside a glass jar, the humidity and the wind cannot damage the instrument.",

        "question": "What is the fundamental property of protons and electrons that leads to electric forces?",
        "referenceAnswer": "The basic property of these protons and electrons is charge. The charge of proton is considered as positive and of electron is negative.",
        "referenceContext": "We know that every matter consists of protons and electrons. Do you know that there are more than 1028 protons and almost equal number of electrons in your body? The basic property of these protons and electrons is charge. The charge of proton is considered as positive and of electron is negative. The charged objects that apply force on each other is known as electric force. The electric force is a basic and important force of nature. In this chapter we will see how a body is charged. We will also learn detect the presence of charge and measure the force between them. As the discussed charges will remain static we will call the chapter Statical Electricity. Finally we will discuss the usage of this static charge and some of its danger and the ways to remain safe from them."

        "question": "Explain how an object can become electrically charged. What is the difference between a positively charged object and a negatively charged object?",
        "referenceAnswer": "As long as the number of electron and proton are equal in any atom, it is electrically neutral. But if their number is not equal in any atom, then the atom will be charged. If the number of electron decreases, the number of proton increases. This situation is said to be charged positively. Again, if these scattered electrons are joined with any atom, the number of its electron increases, as a result it is charged negatively. The shortage or excess of electrons in any atom is considered to be charged.",

        "question": "Describe the process of electrification by friction. What happens when a glass rod is rubbed with silk? How does the charge distribution change?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Silk has more electron affinity than glass and as such these two are rubbed together, the electron of glass goes to silk. As a result, the silk gets charged negatively and the glass rod becomes positively charged. This is why glass rod attracts pith ball [Fig; 10.2]. Again when a rod of ebonite or polythene is rubbed with flannel, polythene rod gets charged negatively and the flannel becomes positively charged. Because polythene has more affinity for electrons than that of flannel and so when they are rubbed together free electrons of flannel moves to ebonite or polythene and gets charged negatively [Fig 10.3].",

        "question": "What is electrostatic induction, and how can it be used to charge a neutral object without direct contact? What are the 'inducing charge' and the 'induced charge'?",
        "referenceAnswer": "The process of charging a neutral body by bringing it very near to the charged body is called electrostatic induction. With a simple experiment the electrostatic induction has been explained below.",
        "referenceContext": "We know that when two bodies are rubbed together electric charge is produced. Again when a charged body is brought in contact with another neutral body the later is charged. When the neutral body is placed not in contact with the charged body but close to the charged body, the former becomes charged. This happens due to induction.
