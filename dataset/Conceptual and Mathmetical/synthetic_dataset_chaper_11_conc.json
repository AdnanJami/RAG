        "question": "What is electric current and how is it produced?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Electric current is the continuous flow of electrons. It is produced when two bodies of different potential are connected by a conducting wire, causing electrons to flow from the body of low potential to that of higher potential. This flow continues until the potential difference between the two bodies becomes zero. If the potential difference is maintained, the flow of electrons will continue.",
        "referenceContext": "When two bodies of different potential are connected by a conducting wire, electrons flow from the body of low potential to that of higher potential. This flow of electron continues until the potential difference between the two bodies becomes zero. If by any process the potential difference between the two objects is maintained, then this flow of electron goes on continuously. This continuous flow of electrons is electric current.\\nThe amount of charge that flows in unit time through any cross section of a conductor is called electric current. If through any cross section of a conductor, the quantity of charge Q flows in time t, then the electric current will be I = Q\\nUnit: The unit of electric current is ampere. If an amount of charge 1 C flows in 1 second through any cross section of a conductor, then the quantity of electric current produced is called 1 A. [But this is not the fundamental definition of ampere. It is given in chapter one, section 1.5.]\\nI = 1C = 1Cs-1 =1A \\n1s \\nFigure: 11.1\\nIn an isolated charged conductor, the charge stays on its surface and do not move. Such type of charges is called electrostatic charge. However, if we can provide a conducting path, the charges will flow instead of being bound on the conductor. When it happens, we say an electric current is produced.\\nHow electric current is produced from moving charges is described in terms of the circuit as shown in figure 11.1. At the start of the experiment, two plug keys K1 and K2 are taken out and the two metal plates A and B are uncharged by touching with hand. Now, if the plug K1 is closed, the high voltage source will be connected to the two metal plates.\\nNext, switch on the high voltage source to charge up the two metal plates positively and negatively by an equal amount. Now, key K1 is removed and key K2 is pluged in to\\nprovide a continuous conducting path linking the positively and negatively charged metal plates to the galvanometer. Here, the galvanometer is a device that can detect the existence of flow of current. It would be observed that the pointer in the galvanometer is seen to deflect momentarily to one side and then quickly return to its initial position.\\nThe galvanometer's deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates."

        "question": "What is the difference between conventional current and electron flow?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Conventional current is the flow of positive charges from higher potential to lower potential, while electron flow is the actual flow of negatively charged electrons from lower potential to higher potential. Therefore, the direction of conventional current is opposite to the actual direction of electron flow.",
        "referenceContext": "When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current. The arrow demonstrated in the diagram is indicating the direction of conventional current."

Mathematically, it can be expressed as V = IR, where V is the potential difference, I is the current, and R is the resistance of the conductor.",
        "referenceContext": "We know, if there is a potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor, current flows through it. The quantity of this electric current depends on the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor, the conductor itself and the temperature of it. George Simon Ohm has discovered the law regarding the relationship between the electric current that flows in a conductor and the potential difference between the two terminals of it- which is known as Ohm's law.\\nOhm's law\\nThe current passing through a conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference between the two ends of the conductor.\\nBy proportionality it means- if the potential difference between the two ends is doubled, the current flowing through the conductor will be doubled. Again, if the potential difference between the two terminals is made one third, the current passing through the conductor will be one third.\\nAssume AB is a conducting wire. The potential of its two terminals are VA and VB [Figure 11.3] respectively. If VA ? VB, The potential difference between the two terminals of the conductor will be V = VA - VB.\\nFigure: 11.3\\nNow at constant temperature, if the current passing through the conductor is I, then according to ohm's law,\\nI ?

Insulators are materials that resist the flow of electric current, such as plastic, rubber, wood, and glass. Semiconductors are materials with conductivity between that of conductors and insulators, such as germanium and silicon.",
        "referenceContext": "We know, electric current is the flow of charges through a material. This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor.\\n1. Conductor: The materials through which electric current can flow very easily are called conductors. Electrons can flow freely within these materials. In metal wires the charges are carried by electrons. So, the metallic materials are good conductors of electricity. Copper, silver, aluminium etc. are good conductors. Due to this reason, metallic wires are used as electric connectors.\\n2. Insulator: The materials through which electric current cannot flow are called insulators. Therefore, the materials where electrons are not free to move about are the\\ninsulators. For example: Plastic, rubber, wood, glass etc. There are no free electrons inside insulating materials. Electrons do not flow easily through plastic type materials. As a result plastics are insulator for electricity. Due to this, the handles of screwdrivers and pliers used by electricians are covered with plastic type materials. In addition, the copper wires which we use in our daily needs are covered with plastic.\\n3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors.

        "question": "What is the difference between electromotive force (EMF) and potential difference?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Electromotive force (EMF) is the work done by a source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit to the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source. It is a measure of the energy provided by the source. Potential difference, on the other hand, is the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. It is a measure of the energy difference between two points in a circuit.",
        "referenceContext": "Electrical energy is needed to produce electric current in a circuit. The electromotive force of an electrical energy source is defined as the work done by the source or the energy spent by the source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit to the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source.\\nIf the work done is W J in bringing Q C of charge in a complete circuit, then the work\\ndone in bringing 1 C of charge is W . Therefore the electromotive force of the source\\nQ\\nis,\\nE ? W\\nQ\\nUnit: The SI unit of electromotive force is JC-1 or volt (V).\\nThe devices which can transform some other forms of energy into electrical energy they only have electromotive force. For example: cell, generator, etc. An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy and a generator coverts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell.\\nPotential difference:\\nThe electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two terminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points. If W is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of charge, then the potential difference between the two points is\\nV ? W\\nQ\\nThe SI unit for potential difference is the same as that for electromotive force. That is volt (V). The potential difference between the two points will be 1 V if 1 J of electrical energy is converted to other forms when 1C positive charge flows between the two points.\\nThe voltmeter reading is the potential difference between the two ends of the bulb or of resistance during the current flow. Now compare the values of the measured electromotive force and potential difference. You will observe that the value of E is larger than that of V."

Length of the conductor: Resistance is directly proportional to the length of the conductor.\\n2. Cross-sectional area of the conductor: Resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the conductor.\\n3.

Conductivity is the reciprocal of resistivity, representing the ability of a material to conduct electric current.",
        "referenceContext": "At constant temperature, the resistance of a conductor of particular material varies proportionately with the length and inversely with the area of cross section. Therefore, we get from the laws of resistance,\\nR ? L\\nA\\nwhen temperature and material remain the same.\\nor, R =? L\\n(11.3)\\nHere ? is a constant, the value of which depends on the material of the conductor and its temperature. This constant is called the resistivity or specific resistance of the material at that temperature.\\nIn equation (11.3), if L=1 unit, A=1 unit, then, ? ? R .\\nTherefore, at a particular temperature, the resistance of a conductor of unit length and unit cross sectional area is called the specific resistance of that material at that temperature.\\nAt a certain temperature, the resistance of a conductor depends on its physical conditions (e.g. length, cross section etc.).

For example- copper is much better conductor of electricity than nichrome. Due to this, copper is widely used as connecting wires in electrical circuits.\\nBesides, materials with higher resistivities also have multiple uses. One example is the nichrome wire. The resistivity and melting point of nichrome is much higher than that of copper. Due to the high resistivity of nichrome, a lot of thermal energy is produced when a current flows through it. This property of nichrome causes water to boil very quickly in electric kettle. The filament of electric bulbs that are used in our houses is made of tungsten. Tungsten can convert electrical energy to light and thermal energy owing to its high resistivity and melting point.\\nConductivity\\nThe reciprocal quantity of resistance is called conductance. Like that, the reciprocal quantity of specific resistance is called conductivity. Conductivity is expressed by the letter ?. The value of ? depends on the type of material of the conductor and its temperature.\\nSay, the specific resistance of the material of a conductor = ?\\nTherefore, the conductivity of its material is ? ? 1\\n?"

        "referenceAnswer": "Equivalent resistance is a single resistance that can replace a combination of resistances without changing the current or potential difference in the circuit. For series combination, the equivalent resistance is the sum of individual resistances (Rs = R1 + R2 + ... + Rn). For parallel combination, the inverse of the equivalent resistance is equal to the sum of the inverses of individual resistances (1/RP = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + ... + 1/Rn).",
        "referenceContext": "Sometimes several resistances are connected together for different purposes. Connection of more than one resistance together is called combination of resistances.\\nEquivalent resistance: If a single resistance is used instead of combination of resistances and if the current and potential difference is not changed in the circuit, then that resistance is called the equivalent resistance of the combination.\\nCombination of resistances is of two types, e.g. - series combination and parallel combination.\\nSeries combination of resistances\\nFigure shows resistors R1, R2 and R3 are connected in series.

Rn\\nTherefore, the equivalent resistance of resistors connected is series is equal to the sum of the different resistances included in the combination. The value of the equivalent resistance in series combination is greater than that of individual resistances.\\nParallel combination of resistances\\nWhen several resistances are connected in such a way that one terminal of all the resistances are joined at a common point A and the other terminals are joined at another common point B and potential difference across each of the resistors remains the same, then this combination of resistances are called parallel combination of resistances."

        "referenceAnswer": "Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is converted into other forms of energy. It is measured in watts (W). Energy consumption is the total amount of electrical energy used over a period of time. It is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh). The relationship between power and energy consumption is that energy consumption is equal to power multiplied by time (W = P*t).",
        "referenceContext": "When a potential difference is applied between the two terminals of a conductor, an electric current is set up. Due to this, work is done and the electrons acquire energy. This electrical energy may be transformed into different forms of energy (e.g.- heat, light, mechanical energy etc.) according to the nature of the circuit.\\nFigure 11.13\\nSay, AB is a conductor of resistance R and Q amount of charge is flowing through it. The potential difference between the points A and B is V. We know, if the potential difference between the two terminals of a conductor is 1 volt and 1 coulomb charge flows through it, then the amount of work done or energy spent is 1joule.

The power of an electric bulb is generally 40, 60 and 100 W. The power of an electric fan is found to 65-75 W commonly. Power of a television is generally 60-70 W.

There is an electricity meter in the houses those use electricity, which maintain the accounts of spent electrical energy. Throughout the world, the electricity supply authority measures the amount of electrical energy consumed in units of kilowatt-hour (kWh).

        "question": "Explain the concept of system loss and load shedding in electricity distribution.",
        "referenceAnswer": "System loss refers to the loss of electrical energy during transmission and distribution due to resistance in the power grid. Load shedding is the intentional interruption of power supply in certain areas when the demand for electricity exceeds the available supply.",
        "referenceContext": "We know, electrical energy is produced in power stations situated at different places. The electricity thus generated has to be transmitted at different places according to the demand. The electrical energy produced is transmitted to the different substations situated at different places by the electricity transmission system. Then from different\\nsubstations this electrical energy is distributed to the consumers by electricity distribution system again.\\nIn the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the i2R loss of the power grid becomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss.\\n\\nLoad shedding\\nEach of the power stations generates a definite amount of electric power. The electricity generated by all the power stations is added in the national power grid. According to the demand of different locality power sub-stations collect electricity from the national grid. Then the power sub-station delivers or distributes the electricity to the consumer level.\\nWhen in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the power sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in some parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. When the sub- station gets the supply according to its demand, then it distributes electricity in that region again.\\nIf the load shedding takes place for a couple of hours continuously, authority load sheds circularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level."

        "referenceAnswer": "Dangers of electricity include electric shocks from damaged insulation, overheating of cables, and damp conditions. Safety measures include using circuit breakers to interrupt excessive current flow, fuses to melt and break the circuit if excessive current is detected, correctly connecting switches to the live wire, and using earth wires to provide a low-resistance path for current to flow to the ground in case of a fault.",
        "referenceContext": "Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\\n1. Damaged insulation\\n2. Overheating of the cables\\n3. Damped conditions\\n1. Damaged insulation:\\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.\\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.\\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual\\nlarge current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.\\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of\\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky.\\nSafe use of electricity\\n\\nFigure: 11.14\\n\\nIn the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. In the present section, we will learn about the safe uses of electricity.\\nWhen using electricity at home, the safety measures that are needed:\\n1. Circuit breaker\\n2. Fuses\\n3. Correct connection of switch\\n4. Earth wire\\n1. Circuit breaker\\nCircuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of a house. Circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply in a circuit when there is an overflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of the house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire.\\n2. Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent excessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the electric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit is disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher current than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If the fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.\\n\\n3. Correct connection of switch: A switch breaks or completes an electrical circuit. During switch connection in a circuit, an important precaution is that the switch must be fitted onto the live wire. For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source from the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be 'live' even if the switch is 'off' [Figure 11.16] and increase the risk of electric shock.\\nFigure 11.15 and 11.16\\n4. Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a complete circuit. These are the live (L) and neutral (N) wire. The live wire delivers the electrical energy to the appliance. On the contrary, the current returns back to the supply through the neutral wire and complete the circuit. The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18."

This flow of electron continues until the potential difference between the two bodies becomes zero. If by any process the potential difference between the two objects is maintained, then this flow of electron goes on continuously. This continuous flow of electrons is electric current.\\nThe amount of charge that flows in unit time through any cross section of a conductor is called electric current. If through any cross section of a conductor, the quantity of charge Q flows in time t, then the electric current will be I = Q\\nUnit: The unit of electric current is ampere. If an amount of charge 1 C flows in 1 second through any cross section of a conductor, then the quantity of electric current produced is called 1 A.

        "referenceAnswer": "Conventional current is the flow of positive charges from higher potential to lower potential, while electron flow is the actual flow of negatively charged electrons from lower potential to higher potential. Therefore, the direction of conventional current is opposite to the actual direction of electron flow.",
        "referenceContext": "When current electricity was invented first, it was assumed that the electricity was produced due to the flow of positive charges. This positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential. So, the direction of conventional current is taken to be from higher potential to lower potential or from positive plate to negative plate of an electric cell. But we know that actually electric current is the flow of negative charges or of electrons, so the actual direction of electric current is from lower potential to higher potential. That is from negative plate to positive plate of an electric cell. Therefore, the actual direction of electric current is opposite to that of conventional current. The arrow demonstrated in the diagram is indicating the direction of conventional current."

        "referenceContext": "Electrical energy is needed to produce electric current in a circuit. The electromotive force of an electrical energy source is defined as the work done by the source or the energy spent by the source in driving a unit positive charge from one point of the circuit to the same point by traversing the complete circuit along with the source.\\nIf the work done is W J in bringing Q C of charge in a complete circuit, then the work\\ndone in bringing 1 C of charge is W .

For example: cell, generator, etc. An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy and a generator coverts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell.\\nPotential difference:\\nThe electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two terminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points. If W is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of charge, then the potential difference between the two points is\\nV ? W\\nQ\\nThe SI unit for potential difference is the same as that for electromotive force. That is volt (V). The potential difference between the two points will be 1 V if 1 J of electrical energy is converted to other forms when 1C positive charge flows between the two points.\\nThe voltmeter reading is the potential difference between the two ends of the bulb or of resistance during the current flow. Now compare the values of the measured electromotive force and potential difference. You will observe that the value of E is larger than that of V."

        "referenceAnswer": "System loss refers to the loss of electrical energy during transmission and distribution due to resistance in the power grid. Load shedding is the intentional interruption of power supply in certain areas when the demand for electricity exceeds the available supply.",
        "referenceContext": "We know, electrical energy is produced in power stations situated at different places. The electricity thus generated has to be transmitted at different places according to the demand. The electrical energy produced is transmitted to the different substations situated at different places by the electricity transmission system. Then from different\\nsubstations this electrical energy is distributed to the consumers by electricity distribution system again.\\nIn the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the i2R loss of the power grid becomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss.\\n\\nLoad shedding\\nEach of the power stations generates a definite amount of electric power. The electricity generated by all the power stations is added in the national power grid. According to the demand of different locality power sub-stations collect electricity from the national grid. Then the power sub-station delivers or distributes the electricity to the consumer level.\\nWhen in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the power sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in some parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. When the sub- station gets the supply according to its demand, then it distributes electricity in that region again.\\nIf the load shedding takes place for a couple of hours continuously, authority load sheds circularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level."

Safety measures include using circuit breakers to interrupt excessive current flow, fuses to melt and break the circuit if excessive current is detected, correctly connecting switches to the live wire, and using earth wires to provide a low-resistance path for current to flow to the ground in case of a fault.",
        "referenceContext": "Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\\n1. Damaged insulation\\n2. Overheating of the cables\\n3. Damped conditions\\n1. Damaged insulation:\\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.\\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.\\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual\\nlarge current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.\\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of\\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky.\\nSafe use of electricity\\n\\nFigure: 11.14\\n\\nIn the previous section you were informed about the dangers of electricity. In the present section, we will learn about the safe uses of electricity.\\nWhen using electricity at home, the safety measures that are needed:\\n1. Circuit breaker\\n2. Fuses\\n3. Correct connection of switch\\n4. Earth wire\\n1. Circuit breaker\\nCircuit breakers are used as safety devices. Generally this is placed near the front door of a house. Circuit breaker switches off the electrical supply in a circuit when there is an overflow of current. Circuit breaker disconnects the electrical supply in a definite part of the house. Without circuit breaker in a circuit, this excessive current can cause damage of home appliances or even start a fire.\\n2. Fuses: A fuse is a safety device. A fuse is included in an electrical circuit to prevent excessive current flow. The fuse is always connected to the live wire of electrical cables. A short thin piece of wire is used as a fuse. The fuse becomes hot and melts when the electric current flowing through it is greater than a definite value. As a result, the circuit is disconnected and the electrical appliances will be safe. The fuse is marked with definite amount of current on its body. Fuses will be such that it can bring slightly higher current than the maximum current an electrical device or appliance can tolerate safely. If the fuse burns, the appliance will not be electrified any more. Before changing fuse, you have to switch off the mains of electricity supply.\\n\\n3. Correct connection of switch: A switch breaks or completes an electrical circuit. During switch connection in a circuit, an important precaution is that the switch must be fitted onto the live wire. For this, switching off will disconnect the high voltage source from the appliance instantly [Figure 11.15]. If the switch is fitted onto the neutral wire wrongly, the electric appliance will be 'live' even if the switch is 'off' [Figure 11.16] and increase the risk of electric shock.\\nFigure 11.15 and 11.16\\n4. Earth wire: All electrical appliances or devices need at least two wires to form a complete circuit. These are the live (L) and neutral (N) wire. The live wire delivers the electrical energy to the appliance. On the contrary, the current returns back to the supply through the neutral wire and complete the circuit. The potential of neutral wire is zero. The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky. How earth wire works as a safety precaution is demonstrated in figure 11.18."

        "referenceContext": "Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\\n1. Damaged insulation\\n2. Overheating of the cables\\n3. Damped conditions\\n1. Damaged insulation:\\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.\\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.\\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual\\nlarge current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.\\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of\\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky."

Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission.

        "referenceContext": "The earth wire is a low-resistance wire. It is usually connected to the metallic casing of the appliance. The circuit may be faulty from different reasons. If the live wire is not properly connected and it touches the metal casing of the appliance- the user may be electrocuted from an electric shock. Earthing of the casing prevents this from happening. In this case, the large current will flow from the live wire to the earth through the metal casing. As a result, the fuse will blow out and cut off the electric supply to the appliance. It is strongly recommended to provide an earthing to the refrigerator in houses for safe use of it. Figure 11.17 demonstrates how a washing machine without earthing may be risky.

        "question": "Why is it advantageous to transmit electricity at high voltage?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Transmitting electricity at high voltage significantly reduces energy loss during transmission. This is because power loss is proportional to the square of the current, and increasing voltage lowers the current for the same amount of power, thereby minimizing the i^2R losses in the transmission lines.",
        "referenceContext": "In the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the i2R loss of the power grid becomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss."

        "referenceContext": "When in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the power sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in some parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. When the sub- station gets the supply according to its demand, then it distributes electricity in that region again.\\nIf the load shedding takes place for a couple of hours continuously, authority load sheds circularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level."

The electromotive force of a cell is the sum of the potential differences which develops in different parts of the circuit along with the cell.\\nPotential difference:\\nThe electricity flows through a conductor due to the potential difference between the two terminals. The potential difference between any two points is defined as the amount of work done to carry unit positive charge from one point to another of a circuit. When a dry cell is used in a torch, the electrical energy provided by the dry cell is converted into light and heat energy. The conservation of energy is maintained in this process of transformation of energy. The amount of energy converted across the light bulb for migration of unit positive charge is the potential difference between the two terminals of the bulb. Therefore, the potential difference between the two points of a circuit is defined as the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy (e.g. - heat, light) when unit positive charge migrates between the two points. If W is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms for migration of Q amount of charge, then the potential difference between the two points is\\nV ? W\\nQ\\nThe SI unit for potential difference is the same as that for electromotive force. That is volt (V). The potential difference between the two points will be 1 V if 1 J of electrical energy is converted to other forms when 1C positive charge flows between the two points.\\nThe voltmeter reading is the potential difference between the two ends of the bulb or of resistance during the current flow. Now compare the values of the measured electromotive force and potential difference. You will observe that the value of E is larger than that of V."

        "question": "Why is it advantageous to transmit electricity at high voltage?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Transmitting electricity at high voltage significantly reduces energy loss during transmission. This is because power loss is proportional to the square of the current, and increasing voltage lowers the current for the same amount of power, thereby minimizing the i^2R losses in the transmission lines.",
        "referenceContext": "In the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent. For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission. As an example- if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth. As a result, the i2R loss of the power grid becomes one hundredth. Therefore, by increasing the transmission line voltage we can lower the system loss."

        "question": "Explain the concept of load shedding and its implications for electricity consumers.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Load shedding is the intentional interruption of power supply in certain areas when the demand for electricity exceeds the available supply. This is done to prevent system overload and ensure a more stable power grid. Consumers experience temporary outages, which can disrupt daily activities and cause inconvenience.",
        "referenceContext": "When in a particular area, the demand of electricity exceeds the supply or generation; the power sub-station can no longer fulfill the demand of electricity. Then the sub-station authority is forced to switch off or to disconnect the power distribution for a while in some parts of the distribution network. This is called load shedding. When the sub- station gets the supply according to its demand, then it distributes electricity in that region again.\\nIf the load shedding takes place for a couple of hours continuously, authority load sheds circularly in different area to make load shedding tolerable at the consumer level."

        "question": "What are the primary safety hazards associated with the use of electricity, and how can they be prevented?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Key hazards include: electric shocks from damaged insulation, overheating of cables, and damp conditions.  Prevention measures include inspecting wires regularly, using appropriate gauge wires, avoiding overloading circuits, keeping appliances dry, and ensuring proper grounding.",
        "referenceContext": "Electricity plays a very important role in our daily lives. Though electricity is very useful to us, it can also be very dangerous in the careless uses. Any type of faults in electrical appliances or circuits can cause fires and electric shocks. Due to the passage of electricity through the body there is a risk of death of people.\\nUses of electricity can be dangerous due to three reasons described below.\\n1. Damaged insulation\\n2. Overheating of the cables\\n3. Damped conditions\\n1. Damaged insulation:\\nThe electrical appliances work when these are connected to the voltage source by two conducting wires to complete the circuit. These two wires are called live and neutral wire. These conducting wires are usually insulated with rubber. Then they are wound together to form a cable and enclosed by PVC or rubber.\\nThese insulating materials become worn with time and use. For example- the electrical cables of the electric iron which we use in home get bent and twisted because of the way they are used. This might cause the electrical insulation to crack and break. As a result, the conducting wires inside is exposed. If by any means a person comes into contact with the exposed live wire, it may cause severe electric shock to the user. If the live and neural wires come into mutual contact due to the damaged insulation, a short circuit will happen and may cause a fire.\\n2. Overheating of the cables: Overheating of cables occur when unusually large current flows through the electric cables or conducting wires. For example- an unusual\\nlarge current flows, when an electric fan motor overheats and melts, as a result the live and neutral wire is fused together. Besides this, we make connection of too many electrical devices in a wall socket by using a multi-plug. Due to this, the conducting wire connected to the socket draws more current from the main line than the current which the conducting wire can draw safely. As a result, the cable wire is overheated, insulation is melted and causes fire.\\n3. Damped conditions: Many electrical accidents may occur in damped conditions. We know, electricity can pass through water. The parts of an electric appliance which are not insulated must be kept dry. Otherwise, there is a risk of short circuits and electric shocks. As an example, leaving a hair dryer on a wet sink is very dangerous. The person using the sink could be electrocuted if the wires were exposed or the insulation had damaged. Besides this, switching on or off of\\nan electric switch by wet hand is risky."
