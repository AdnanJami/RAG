He demonstrated that moving a magnet near a coil or changing the current in a nearby coil can induce a current in the closed circuit.",

        "question": "How does an electric motor convert electrical energy into mechanical energy?",
        "referenceAnswer": "An electric motor utilizes the interaction between a magnetic field and a current-carrying conductor to produce rotational motion. A coil of wire carrying current is placed within a magnetic field. The interaction between the magnetic field and the current in the coil creates a force, causing the coil to rotate.  The rotation is made continuous by a commutator, which reverses the direction of current in the coil as it rotates, ensuring constant torque and rotation.",
        "referenceContext": "Suppose a loop or coil of wire like picture 12.8(a) is used between the two poles of magnet .As the loop has returned to the opposite direction from A to B, the opposite electricity will flow between the two half of the loop or coil. So, the wire will go to the upward in A and downward in B. For this the wire moves in clockwise. At the vertical position of the wire like figure 12.8(b) no force will act on it. For this it will be stopped. To keep the coil rotating, we will use a device named commutator. It consists of two\\nequal segments made of copper (see figure12.9). Each segment is connected to A and B respectively. The outer part of the separated segment makes a contact with the electric source through carbon brush. The segment moves with the coil and when its' gap between two side remains opposite to the carbon brush, no current will flow. But despite this fact, the movement will remain continue for its inertia and it will get force newly when it will come to the contact of the moving brush. Thus the rotation will remain continue."

        "question": "Explain the difference between a step-up transformer and a step-down transformer, and give an example of where each is used.",
        "referenceAnswer": "A step-up transformer increases voltage by having more turns in its secondary coil than its primary coil. This is used for transmitting electricity over long distances, as higher voltage reduces energy loss.  A step-down transformer reduces voltage by having fewer turns in the secondary coil. It is used to provide safe and suitable voltage for household appliances and devices. For instance, a step-up transformer is used at a power plant to increase voltage before sending electricity over long distances, and a step-down transformer is used at a substation to reduce voltage before it is distributed to homes.",
