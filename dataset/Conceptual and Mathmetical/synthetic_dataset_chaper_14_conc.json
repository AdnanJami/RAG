        "referenceAnswer": "Bio-physics is such a branch of science which is developed on the basis of a number of branches of science. Theories and methods of physical science are employed in biophysics to study a system of biology. Biology is the science of studying living world. How plants and animals collect food, communicate, percept from the environment and reproduce are discussed in biology. On the other hand the mathematical rule which nature follows is the subject-matter of physics. For a long period, the scientists believed that the laws of living world and physical world are different. But with the progress of physical and biological science, a deep harmony is found between these two apparently different disciplines. At first physics and biology has evolved as two different subjects. The mutual relationship and coordination between these two subjects has increased a lot with the advancement of science. It was thought before that living world follows a different rule and the laws of physical science are applicable only for the inanimate objects. But now we know that the animal body can be compared to a machine from many aspects and it is possible to explain many behaviors of animal body with the help of physical laws.

His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research. He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated\\n\\nwave to millimeter level (about 5 mm). He was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio signal.

Earlier it was thought that, the nature of response of plants to different stimuli is chemical, but he became able to show that it is electric in nature.",
        "referenceContext": "14.2 Contributions of Jagadish Chandra Bose\\nAcharya Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose was a physicist as well as a biologist. In our sub- continent he is the first internationally recognized scientist. Bose family hailed from the village Rarikhal of Bikrampur under district of Dhaka. He was born in Mymensingh on 30th November, 1958. His father Bhagawan Chandra Bose was a deputy magistrate in the district of Faridpur. Bose's education started at a vernacular school in Faridpur. Next he got admitted to Hare school and Saint Xavier's school and college in Kolkata and passed his student life. After completing B.A. he went to England for higher study in the year 1880. His student life in England was from 1880 to 1884. He completed the B.A. degree with honours in physics from University of Cambridge and a B. Sc. degree from University of London. In 1885, he started as a professor of physics in Presidency College. Though there were not adequate facilities of research in Presidency College, he carried out his research work. As there was scarcity of time in day, he had to conduct his research work in night many times. In the laboratory he researched a lot about, how radio signals can be transmitted to a distant place without the help of wire and succeeded. In 1895, for the first time in history he sent radio signal to a distant place without wire and demonstrated in public. He has mentionable contributions in micro- wave research. He was the first who was able to reduce the wavelength of generated\\n\\nwave to millimeter level (about 5 mm). He was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio signal. Instead of taking commercial benefit from this invention, he opened it for all, so that others can develop this research more.\\nSubsequently, Jagadish Chandra Bose made a number of important and pioneering discoveries in plant physiology.
