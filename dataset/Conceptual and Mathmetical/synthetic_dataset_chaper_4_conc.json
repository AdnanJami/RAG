        "referenceAnswer": "In everyday language, 'work' refers to any activity. However, in physics, work has a specific definition. Work is done when a force acts on an object and causes it to displace. It requires both force and displacement for work to be done.",

He might say he has done work to hold the boat otherwise the current of the river could pull it away. These are recognized as work in our daily life but these are not work in the point of view of science. Rather had the gateman guarded the house walking instead of sitting or had the boat floated with the current of the river, work could have been done.
