        "referenceContext": "Heat is a kind of energy which creates the sensation of hotness and coldness. Heat flows from hotter to colder bodies. Therefore the energy that transfers from one body to another due to the difference of temperature is called heat.\\nThe molecules of a substance always remain in the state of vibratory motion. So they possess kinetic energy. The total amount of energy of a substance is directly proportional to the sum of the kinetic energy of the molecules constituting the substance. When heat is applied to a body the motion of the molecules increases and as a result the kinetic energy of the molecules increases."

        "referenceAnswer": "Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to temperature changes. Solids expand linearly, liquids expand volumetrically, and gases expand the most due to the weak intermolecular forces between their molecules. The coefficient of thermal expansion varies depending on the material.",

When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it.

Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum.\\nPressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease of pressure.

        "referenceAnswer": "Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to temperature changes. Solids expand linearly, liquids expand volumetrically, and gases expand the most due to the weak intermolecular forces between their molecules. The coefficient of thermal expansion varies depending on the material.",
        "referenceContext": "Almost all the substances expand due to application of heat and contract for the extraction of heat. When a body is heated the heat energy and as such the kinetic energy of each molecule of the body increases. In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior. As such the average equilibrium position of each molecule gets displaced towards the exterior and the body expands. Since intermolecular force is less in liquids, expansion due to heat is more in it. For gaseous substances with the increase of temperature the random motion of the molecules increases. The thermal expansion of gases is maximum. The expansion of liquid is lower than that of gas and expansion of solid is the least."

        "referenceContext": "Evaporation depends on the following factors:\\nFlow of air: The speed of evaporation increases if the air flows faster over the liquid.\\nThe area of the exposed surface of the liquid: Evaporation increases as the area of the exposed surface of the liquid increases.\\nNature of liquid: The rates of evaporation of different liquids are different. Less the boiling point of a liquid, more would be the rate of evaporation. The rate of evaporation of volatile substances is maximum.\\nPressure on the liquid: The rate of evaporation decreases with the increase of atmospheric pressure on the liquid. The rate of evaporation increases with the decrease of pressure. The rate of evaporation in vacuum is maximum.\\nLiquid and the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid: If the temperature of the air in contact with the liquid increases then the rate of evaporation will increase.\\nEffect of dryness: The more the dryness of the air over the liquid surface i.e. the less the amount of water vapor in the air more will be the rate of evaporation.
