        "referenceContext": "The characteristics of a solar cell are that the cell produces electricity instantly while solar rays fall upon it. There are various uses of solar cell.\n1. This cell is used to supply electricity in artificial satellites. For this reason the artificial satellites move along their orbits for a long time.\n2. Solar energy is being used to operate different electronic devices like pocket calculator, pocket radio and electronic watch.\n3. Currently electrical energy is produced from solar energy in the rural area, houses or offices to meet up the need of electricity.\nThe advantage of solar energy is that it does not pollute the environment. There is almost no possibility of danger in using this energy. There is also no possibility of sudden exhaustion of solar energy. This is why it is likely to be used as a prospective fuel instead of fossil fuel.\nHydroelectricity (Transformation of mechanical energy):\nWater is one of the renewable sources of energy.

It is seen that up to 70% of this energy is lost as heat energy.\nAt last only the 30% of input energy is transformed into useable electrical energy. So, we can say the efficiency of the electricity production centre is 30%.\nMathematical Example 4.5: An electric motor is used to lift a body of weight 10N at a height 5m"

So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance.\n(ii) The area of the sharp edge of the knife is very small"

All of a sudden if the mercury height falls down then it is to be realized that the atmospheric pressure of the surrounding area has fallen down and low pressure has been created. The air at a high pressure from the neighboring area will rush with tremendous speed to the depression area. So, there is a possibility of storm.\n3. When the height of the mercury column of the barometer slowly increases, then it indicates that water vapor from the air is being disappeared and dry air is occupying that space. So, the weather will remain dry and clear"

If the cross sectional area of the larger one is 100 times greater than that of the smaller one, then a force of 1N applied to the smaller one will produce an upward force of 100N on the larger piston.\n\n\n5.11 Elasticity: Stress and Strain\nFrom our general knowledge we know a rubber tape elongates along its length when it is pulled. As soon as the tape is released of the tension it regains its original length or tends to get back its previous length"

        "referenceContext": "In solids the molecules vibrate with enhance energy against the intermolecular force and as a result the displacements of the molecules from their equilibrium position increase. But during displacement of a molecule from its equilibrium position a force of attraction is exerted on it. When the molecule tends to go near to its neighboring molecules then a repulsive force acts on it. Again with the increase of intermolecular distance a force of attraction acts on the molecule. For the increase in temperature the molecules of a solid vibrate but it is not a simple harmonic oscillation. Because, if the distance between two molecules is lessened than the distance in their equilibrium position then the repulsive force increases rapidly. But as the distance between two molecules relative to their equilibrium position increases, then the attractive force increases. But it does not happen as quickly as in the case of repulsive force. As a result due to increase of temperature when the molecules of a body vibrate at a random fashion they approach further towards the exterior than towards the interior"

The reason behind it is the reflection of light. Figure 8.1 shows how we can see a luminous (sun) and a non-luminous (cat) object. Eye sees the luminous object because light enters the eye directly from it. The light coming from the luminous object reflected by the cat enters our eyes and so we can see the cat.\nFigure 8.1\n\n\nIn a homogenous transparent medium (e.g.- glass) light travels in straight line with the same velocity. But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium"

As these two rays are diverging, if they are extended backward they meet at the point I. Therefore, the reflected rays seem to be diverging from the point I behind the mirror. This point I is the image of the point O.\nIf a beam of rays after being reflected from or refracted through any surface meet at a second point or appears to diverge from the second point, then the second point is called the image of the first point. An object is the sum of innumerable points. As a result, image of an object is formed as like as an individual point.\nClassification of images\nWhen you see your appearance in a mirror, you see your image behind the mirror"

        "referenceAnswer": "Myopia is corrected by using a concave lens. This lens diverges the incoming light rays, causing them to converge on the retina, resulting in clear vision. The power of the concave lens needed to correct myopia depends on the severity of the defect.",
        "referenceContext": "This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:\n\n\n1. Short sight or Myopia\n2. Long sight or Hypermetropia\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ]\nEffects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig"

For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ]\nRemedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object. Therefore, to rectify short sight, a concave lens or spectacles should be used as aid lens in front of the eye.
