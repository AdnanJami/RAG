        "answer": "Galileo Galilei and Johannes Kepler are known for their work, but Sir Isaac Newton is most often credited with establishing the fundamental principles of motion. He formulated three laws of motion that describe how objects move and respond to forces. The first law states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and direction unless acted upon by an external force.",

        "answer": "Newton's three laws of motion are:\n\n1. **First Law (Law of Inertia)**: Every object will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless an external force is applied to it.\n2. **Second Law**: The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force acting on it and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.\n3. **Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When two objects interact, they apply forces to one another that are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.\n\nThese laws help us understand how forces affect motion and why objects respond a certain way to different types of forces.",

Newton\u2019s second law gives the equation for the measurement of force. From Newton\u2019s second law we know the relationship between the force acting on a body and the acceleration produced due to this force. The law is as follows:\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force acting on it and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.Again from Newton\u2019s first law we see that to change the state of a body something external must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change the state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton\u2019s first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton\u2019s first law, a force is that which acting on a body at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or tends to change its state of motion.\n\nPhysics\n\n51"

So the velocity changes only for its magnitude.The molecules of a substance move away form each other when external force is applied on elastic bodies. Original length, volume or size and shape of a body are changed due to this applied deforming force. The change per unit length or per unit volume of an object is called strain. Whenever an external force deforms a body, an internal resistive force will develop inside the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into play to resist the applied external force. This developedWhen a body moves or tends to move over another body, then a resistance is developed between the two surfaces in contact, which is known as friction. This resistive force is called frictional force.\n\nPhysics\n\nThe frictional force always acts opposite to the motion and obstructs the motion.\n\nOrigin of frictionof position. The velocity states the rate of change of position along with its direction that is, velocity means the rate of change of position in a definite direction or in other words the rate of change of displacement. Hence velocity of a body is its rate of change of displacement with time, that is the distance traveled by a moving body in unit time in a definite direction is called the velocity of the body."

A permanent change of shape may mean the failure of a structure- as a bridge collapse due to excess load.The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object.What will happen when the two ends of a spring is stretched and tied to two objects and then released? The objects will move fast and collide with each other. The stretched spring was at rest but potential energy was there in it. If it is released it may work. The energy was stored in the stretched spring because it was strained.\n\nThe ability of a body to do work when its normal position or configuration is changed to some other position or configuration is called potential energy.configuration and was able to displace the other body. This ability of spring to work for the change of its normal configuration is its potential energy. If some work is done against the force at the time of changing from normal position or configuration to some other position or configuration then the body obtains the capacity of doing work that is same amount of energy is stored in it. This principle is applicable within the sphere of influence of conservative force such as electric force,"

        "question": "What is an example of a permanent change of shape that can lead to structural failure?",
        "answer": "A good example of a permanent change of shape leading to structural failure is a bridge collapse due to excess load. When a heavy object falls on a bridge, it applies a tremendous force that causes the steel beams or pillars to permanently bend or break, leading to the collapse of the structure. This type of deformation results in a loss of structural integrity and can cause catastrophic failures.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented by Hooke's Law: F = kx (Force = spring constant \u00d7 displacement), where x is the permanent deformation or strain. In the case of a bridge, the applied force (F) exceeds the material's breaking point, resulting in permanent damage and failure.",

The shape of an empty plastic bottle changes when it is pressed. Again when a rubber band is stretched by pulling it, it becomes narrow and its shape changes.The molecules of a substance move away form each other when external force is applied on elastic bodies. Original length, volume or size and shape of a body are changed due to this applied deforming force. The change per unit length or per unit volume of an object is called strain. Whenever an external force deforms a body, an internal resistive force will develop inside the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into play to resist the applied external force. This developed"

Newton\u2019s first law of motion is-\n\n\u2018Every object will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless an external force is applied to it.\u2019\n\nNewton\u2019s first law expresses the property of inertia of matter.Again from Newton\u2019s first law we see that to change the state of a body something external must be applied. That is, the external cause which changes or tends to change the state of an object is called force. Thus from Newton\u2019s first law we get qualitative definition of force. According to Newton\u2019s first law, a force is that which acting on a body at rest produces or tends to produce motion or acting on a moving body changes or tends to change its state of motion.\n\nPhysics\n\n51From Newton\u2019s first law of motion we observe that a body cannot change its state on its own. If the body is at rest, it tends to remain at rest forever and if it is in motion it tends to keep on motion with uniform speed for all time. This property of a body is termed as inertia. Thus from the Newton\u2019s first law of motion we get the concept of inertia.3.6 Relation between force and acceleration- Newton\u2019s second law\n\nNewton\u2019s first law gives qualitative definition of force. Newton\u2019s second law gives the equation for the measurement of force. From Newton\u2019s second law we know the relationship between the force acting on a body and the acceleration produced due to this force. The law is as follows:\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force acting on it and takes place in the direction in which the force acts."

        "answer": "The marble eventually stops rolling on the floor due to friction between the marble and the floor. The frictional force acts in the direction opposite to the motion, causing the marble to slow down and come to rest.\n\nFriction is described by the equation:\n\nF = \u03bcN\n\nwhere F is the frictional force, \u03bc (mu) is the coefficient of friction, and N is the normal force.\n\nFor rolling motion, we also consider the torque (rotational force):\n\n\u03c4 = r x F\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the torque, r is the radius of the rolling object, and F is the frictional force. This causes the marble to slow down due to rotational drag.\n\nIn summary, the marble stops rolling because the frictional force opposes its motion, causing it to lose kinetic energy and eventually come to rest.",

        "context": " seen that the marble comes to rest after traversing a small distance. This happens due to the friction of the floor. When the marble is in motion on the floor, a frictional force is developed due to the mutual friction between the marble and the floor.

If the friction of the floor was absent, then the marble would continue its perpetual motion with uniform velocity.We are familiar with friction in various ways in our daily lives. From Newton\u2019s first law of motion we know that if no force acts on a body the body will continue in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. Does it actually happen in reality? Take a marble and roll it on the floor. When you roll the marble, you apply a force on it. As a result, the marble becomes mobile on the ground.

So, if a force acts on a body and causes its displacement only then work is said to be done. We see many examples of work around us in our daily life. For example,[By work we mean to do something in our everyday life. But in physics it refers to a specific concept. In the beginning of this chapter we will present this concept. The most important topic in science is energy. From our experience we see that the world becomes inactive without energy. We get energy in different forms. Such as kinetic energy for motion, potential energy for object in higher position from the ground, the energy of spring at contract condition or expanding condition, heat energyAs work is said to be done only when a force is acted on a body and displaces it, so in the above examples (b) and (c) work is done but in the example (a) and (d) no work is done. We can apply force to shift a body from one place to another. We can change the shape of any body by applying force. In these cases work is done."

The fundamental driving force behind all physical phenomena, including motion and interactions, would cease to exist. Without energy, there would be:\n\n1. No light: No photons would travel through space, and thus no light would reach our eyes or other objects.\n2. No sound: There would be no vibrations in molecules, resulting in silence.\n3. No motion: Objects would not move, including stars, planets, and galaxies.\n4. No chemical reactions: No energy would exist to drive chemical bonds, meaning no life as we know it.\n\nIn short, the universe as we know it would be a static, dark, and silent void.",

Newton\u2019s second law gives the equation for the measurement of force. From Newton\u2019s second law we know the relationship between the force acting on a body and the acceleration produced due to this force. The law is as follows:\n\nThe rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force acting on it and takes place in the direction in which the force acts.The rate of change of velocity with time that is the change of velocity in unit time is known as acceleration. The rate of increase of velocity with time of a body moving in a straight line is called positive acceleration and the rate of decrease of velocity of a body with time is called negative acceleration.

The stretched spring was at rest but had stored potential energy due to strain. When released, this energy is transferred from the spring's potential energy state to its kinetic energy state, causing the objects attached to the spring to move fast and collide with each other.\n\nMathematically, the conversion can be described by:\n\nPotential Energy (PE) = 0.5 \u00d7 k \u00d7 x^2\n\nwhere:\nk = spring constant\nx = displacement from equilibrium position\n\nWhen released, PE \u2192 Kinetic Energy (KE)\n\nKE = 0.5 \u00d7 m \u00d7 v^2\n\nwhere:\nm = mass of the object\nv = velocity of the object",

Actually as deformation of a body occurs, a resistive force generates within the body for which it tends to get back its original size and shape.configuration and was able to displace the other body.

        "answer": "The primary cause of wind flow is the uneven heating of the Earth's surface by the sun. This temperature difference creates a pressure gradient, where air moves from high to low pressure areas. The rotation of the Earth also plays a role in shaping the direction and speed of winds.\n\nMathematically, it can be described by the Navier-Stokes equations, which relate the motion of fluids (like air) to their pressure, density, and velocity. However, for simple wind flow problems, a simplified equation like Bernoulli's principle is often used:\n\nP + 1/2 \u03c1 v^2 + \u03c1 g h = constant\n\nwhere P is pressure, \u03c1 is density, v is velocity, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is height.\n\nIn simple terms, as the sun heats the Earth, it warms the air closest to the surface. This warm air rises, creating an area of low pressure near the ground. Meanwhile, cooler air moves in from surrounding areas to fill the gap, creating a gentle breeze or wind.",

He also observes that the element that emits radiation, transforms totally into a new element. This is a nuclear event. This event is a spontaneous and continuous phenomenon and fully controlled by the nature. Any manmade external influences such as- pressure, heat, electric and magnetic field cannot stop or increase ordecrease the emission of these rays. Later Madame Marie Curie (1867-1934) and her husband Pierre Curie (1859-1906) observed the similar events. They noticed that similar type of radiation also emits from the heavy elements like Polonium, Thorium and Actinium etc. This radiation is now-a-days known as radioactive rays. The phenomenon of emission of radioactive rays or particles from an element is called radioactivity. Radioactive elements emit three energetic rays, namely alpha, beta and gamma.Dangers of electricity\n\nElectricity plays a very important role in our daily lives.

The electricity thus generated has to be transmitted at different places according to the demand. The electrical energy produced is transmitted to the different substations situated at different places by the electricity transmission system. Then from different substations this electrical energy is distributed to the consumers by electricity distribution system again.In the power station the electrical energy is generated at low voltage. Then this low voltage is transformed into high voltage by the step-up transformer. The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat. That is, a loss or decay of energy occurs. This loss of energy is termed as system loss. Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the192\n\nPhysics\n\nLoad shedding\n\nEach of the power stations generates a definite amount of electric power.

The stretched spring was at rest but potential energy was there in it. If it is released it may work. The energy was stored in the stretched spring because it was strained.\n\nThe ability of a body to do work when its normal position or configuration is changed to some other position or configuration is called potential energy.A temporary change of shape may provide a useful way of absorbing and storing energy. Compressing the spring by rotation of the key the potential energy is stored in a toy car. When the car is released the potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy. A permanent change of shape may mean the failure of a structure- as a bridge collapse due to excess load.96\n\nPhysics\n\n5.11 Elasticity: Stress and Strain\n\nFrom our general knowledge we know a rubber tape elongates along its length when it is pulled. As soon as the tape is released of the tension it regains its original length or tends to get back its previous length. Here pull means application of force and elongation in length means deformation. Actually as deformation of a body occurs, a resistive force generates within the body for which it tends to get back its original size and shape.The molecules of a substance move away form each other when external force is applied on elastic bodies. Original length, volume or size and shape of a body are changed due to this applied deforming force. The change per unit length or per unit volume of an object is called strain. Whenever an external force deforms a body, an internal resistive force will develop inside the body due to its elastic property. This opposing force comes into play to resist the applied external force. This developed"

Liquids and gases can flow easily so they are called fluids. The fluid can create pressure. We can do many works using pressure of fluids. Elasticity is a special characteristic of matter. We will discuss all these in this chapter.]mass per unit volume of a substance is called the density of its material. Density is a general property of matter. Density of a body depends on its material and temperature.We know that each matter is consisted of small particles. The atom of every matter consists of electrons and which revolves around the nucleus. In the nucleus there are two type of particles-proton and neutron. The fundamental and special property of primary particles (electron and proton) of which the matter consist of is electrical property, which is determined by charge. The charges of electrons are negative and the charges of protons are considered to be positive. Neutron is electrically6.2 Thermometric properties of matter:\n\nSpecial properties of matter are used to measure the temperature. Some physical properties of substances change uniformly with the change of temperature. Using that physical property of substance temperature can be measured easily and accurately and it is called the thermometric property of that substance. Thermometric substances are used in thermometers."

So when the sharp end of the nail is placed on a wood like surface and hammered on the flat head of the nail, comparatively more pressure is exerted on the sharp end as a result the nail easily enters into the substance.We have a general concept about force from our daily life experiences. When we pull or push a body, then we say a force is applied upon the body. This applied force can create or tends to create motion in a stationary body. If the body is in motion, then the applied force can cease the motion of the body or tries to increase its velocity. In both cases to apply force, it needs direct contact between the force applier and the body. These types of force are known as contact force. If the twoWhen a body tends to move or move over another body, then a resistive frictional force is produced against the motion between the contact surfaces of two bodies. Here the frictional force is produced due to direct contact between the surfaces of the two bodies. We apply pulling force on a box when we pull it over the floor. At that time frictional force is produced opposite to the motion of the box.force is the consequence of the direct contact between the hand and the body. The examples of contact forces are- frictional force, pulling force and the force created during collision."

        "question": "Why is it easier to drive a nail into wood with the sharp end?",
        "answer": "With the given context, I'll explain why it's easier to drive a nail into wood with the sharp end.\n\nThe answer lies in the concept of friction and the direction of force. When you apply force with the sharp end of a nail, the edge creates a smaller cross-sectional area, which increases the pressure on the wood.\n\nPressure (P) is calculated as:\n\nP = F/A\n\nWhere P is pressure, F is the force applied, and A is the cross-sectional area.\n\nWhen you drive the nail into the wood with the sharp end, the force is concentrated in a small area, resulting in higher pressure. This increased pressure causes more friction between the nail and the wood, making it easier to penetrate the wood.\n\nIn contrast, when you apply force with the flat side of the nail, the force is spread over a larger cross-sectional area, resulting in lower pressure. As a result, the nail penetrates the wood more slowly and requires more effort.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as \"pressure point\" or \" concentrated pressure.\"",

        "question": "Why don't people generally feel atmospheric pressure?",
        "answer": "Atmospheric pressure is like weight on your body, but it's not always noticeable because it's evenly distributed all over. The air outside your body has a certain amount of weight (pressure) due to its density, and that same force is also acting on the Earth's surface. This combined effect creates an atmospheric pressure of about 105 N/m\u00b2.\n\nHowever, inside your body, the blood has some extra pressure compared to the atmosphere, so it doesn't feel like there's a big difference. But when air blows over your sweating body, it can create a cooling effect. Here's why:\n\nWhen air flows over a hot surface (like your sweaty skin), it rapidly loses heat due to convection. This is because the moving air carries away some of the warm air closest to the skin, leaving cooler air behind. As a result, the evaporation rate increases since there's more moisture in the air.\n\nThe faster-moving air strips away the layer of moist air closest to your skin, allowing it to cool down. So, even though the internal blood pressure might be similar to atmospheric pressure, the rapid movement of air over your body can still make you feel cooler due to increased evaporation and heat loss.\n\nThink of it like this: when a car's engine cools down, what happens? You add more coolant (or moisture) to keep it running! Similarly, as air blows over your sweating skin, it \"cools\" the system by removing extra moisture, making you feel cooler.",

        "question": "What is Pascal's Law?",
        "answer": "Pascal's law states that when a force is applied to a confined fluid (liquid), the same force is transmitted to all points of the fluid and causes an equal increase in pressure at every point. This means that if you apply more force to a piston, it will push down on other pistons with greater forces, even if they have different areas.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n\nF1 / A1 = F2 / A2\n\nWhere F1 and F2 are the forces applied to pistons of area A1 and A2 respectively.\n\nFor example, if you apply 100N of force to a piston with an area of 10m\u00b2, the pressure would be 10 Nm\u207b\u00b2. But if you apply the same 100N of force to another piston with an area of 100m\u00b2, the pressure would be 1 Nm\u207b\u00b2, because the area is much larger.\n\nIn essence, Pascal's law explains why objects float on water: the weight of the object (force) is distributed over a large surface area of water (area), which reduces the pressure exerted on the object, allowing it to float.",

As the molecules slow down, they move closer together, causing the substance to contract in shape and volume.

        "question": "Why do molecules in a solid tend to move further towards the exterior than towards the interior when heated?",
        "answer": "When a solid is heated, the kinetic energy of its molecules increases. This causes them to vibrate more vigorously against their intermolecular forces. As a result, the molecules are pushed away from their equilibrium positions and move further apart.\n\nThe force that opposes this movement is the attractive force between adjacent molecules. However, in a solid, this force is not always balanced by an equal force pushing the molecule back towards its neighboring molecule. When heated, the repulsive force decreases as the distance between molecules increases. This allows more energy to push the molecules away from their equilibrium positions.\n\nAdditionally, in a solid, there is also a \"hard core\" effect due to which the attractive force between two molecules decreases with increasing intermolecular distance and increases rapidly when the distance becomes less than the equilibrium distance. So, it is more favorable for the molecules of a solid to move further away from each other rather than towards each other when heated.",

Mathematically, it's represented as:\n\n\u03b1 = \u0394L / L * \u0394T\n\nIn simpler terms, it's the ratio of the increase in length to the original length when the temperature changes.\n\nFor example, if an object's length increases by 1 cm when its temperature rises from 20\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C, the coefficient of linear expansion would be:\n\n\u03b1 = 1 cm / 10 cm * (30\u00b0C - 20\u00b0C) = 0.01 K-1\n\nThis means that for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, the object's length will expand by 0.01 cm.",

        "question": "What is the primary effect of heat absorption during the conversion of a solid to a liquid?",
        "answer": "The primary effect of heat absorption during the conversion of a solid to a liquid is to break the intermolecular bonds among the molecules. This results in the transformation from a solid (solid-state) to a liquid (liquid-state). In other words, heat energy is used to loosen or \"loosen\" the bonds between molecules, allowing them to move more freely and become part of the liquid state.",

        "answer": "Evaporation is a cooling process that occurs when liquid (water) turns into vapor. In the case of the earthen pitcher, many tiny pores allow water to seep out and evaporate. As water evaporates, it absorbs heat from its surroundings, which cools down the surrounding air and eventually the water itself.\n\nThe equation for evaporation is:\n\nQ = mL\n\nWhere:\nQ = heat energy\nm = mass of water\nL = latent heat of vaporization (a constant value that depends on temperature)\n\nIn simple terms, as water evaporates, it absorbs heat from its surroundings and loses its temperature.

The heat in the deep of earth is so high that it can melt pieces of rocks. This melted rock is called Magma. This Magma sometimes rises up and remains stored just below the surface of the ground due to geological changes. These types of places are known as hot spot. When the water under the ground comes in contact with the hot spot it turns into steam which remains stored in the ground. This steam could be let out passing a pipe throughFrom ancient times man is using sunlight directly to dry things. At present man is adopting various means to use the solar energy round the clock. Ignition can be done by concentrating sun\u2019s rays- with the help of a convex lens. Solar cooker consists of a metallic bowl on which the solar rays are reflected.

Here the amount of heat required to transform the solid into liquid is nothing but latent heat of fusion.\n\nThis heat energy does not change the temperature but is used to loosen the intermolecular bond of the molecules of the substances.Latent heat of vaporization: If heat is applied to a liquid and its temperature reaches at the boiling point then whatever amount of heat is applied the temperature will remain unchanged until all the liquid is converted into vapor state. Here the amount of heat required to convert the liquid into vapor state is called latent heat of vaporization.On further heating the temperature of water of 0\u00b0C starts to rise. At a stage, water starts vaporizing and the temperature remains unchanged. During this time water absorbs heat to become vapor. Here also the effect of heat is used to break the intermolecular bond among the liquid molecules. On the other way around, gaseous substance may be converted to liquid and liquid to solid by extracting heat from them. So, on the transformation of substances effect of heat is remarkable."

        "question": "What happens to light when it travels from one medium to another?",
        "answer": "When light travels from one medium to another, two main things can happen: \n\n1. **Reflection**: If the light hits the surface at a shallow angle (or grazing), most of it bounces back into the first medium.\n\n2. **Refraction**: When the light hits the surface at an angle, some or all of it bends and passes into the second medium. The amount of bending depends on how different the velocities are between the two media. If you go from a rarer (air) to a denser (glass) medium, the light bends towards the normal (perpendicular to the surface). But if you go from a denser to a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal.\n\nThis bending is due to a change in velocity when the light passes into a new medium with a different optical density.",

But when light travelling through the first medium falls on the surface of a second medium, then a portion of the light returns back to the first medium from the surface of separation of two medium. This phenomenon is called reflection of light.Since the velocity of light differs from medium to medium, during the change of medium refraction takes place. When ray of light enters from a rarer medium (air) to a denser medium (glass) the refracted ray bends towards the normal i.e. in this case i>r again when it enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium it goes away from the normal i.e. in this case r>i.Look at figure 9.1. here two media, air and glass are shown. Coming from air medium following the path AB, light ray incidents at point B of the separation surface PQ of two media. If the light ray goes straight it will follow the path BC\u2032 but it changes its path and follows BC. This phenomenon of bending of ray of light is called refraction.

As a result, the reflected rays which enter to our eyes are diffused in nature. Due to this, the objectsWhen light is reflected from a surface, then it must obey the laws of reflection. How light will be reflected from a surface depends upon the nature of the reflecting surface. Depending on the nature of the reflecting surface, reflection may be of two kinds.\n\n1.

        "answer": "A periscope works using two plane mirrors to change the direction of light from an object, allowing us to see it even if we're blocked by an obstacle.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented by Snell's Law: \n\nn1 sin(\u03b81) = n2 sin(\u03b82)\n\nwhere:\n- n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two mediums (in this case, air and glass)\n- \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction\n\nIn a periscope, light from an object hits one mirror at 45\u00b0 with the normal (perpendicular to the surface), then reflects off that mirror to another mirror at the same angle. This changes the direction of the light by 90\u00b0 (from \u03b81 = 45\u00b0 to \u03b82 = 0\u00b0).\n\nBy using two mirrors, we can change the direction of light again and get an image of the object on a screen.\n\nThe equation for the total path length (or distance) traveled by the light in the periscope is:\n\nL = L1 + L2\n\nwhere:\n- L is the total path length\n- L1 is the path length through the first mirror (45\u00b0 incidence angle)\n- L2 is the path length through the second mirror (90\u00b0 change in direction)\n\nUsing trigonometry, we can find that L = 2L1 / sin(45\u00b0)",

For any reason, if the object is moved forward to or backward from the lens, the screen is to be moved forward or backward as well to get a clear image. Now if we want to get a clear image of the object on the screen at its previous position, we have to use lenses of different focal lengths.An optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner wall of the stomach of any patient. A set of optical fiber of this optical tube is sent to lighten the stomach and the other set helps to see the lightened portion of stomach from the outside. This process is known as endoscopy. In this way by sending optical tube the block inside the artery, vein and function of valves of heart can be observed. Optical fiber is used for sending or receiving electrical signals"

They help the driver see everything around them, especially when turning, by using large area mirrors fitted at an angle of 45\u00b0. This allows the driver to check what's behind and beside the car before making any moves.\n\nMathematically, this is related to optics and angles. When you put a mirror at an angle, it creates a wider field of view. The 45\u00b0 angle used for turning mirrors allows the driver to see more of their surroundings without having to physically turn around.\n\nThink of it like this: if you're facing straight ahead and want to check what's behind you, you'd have to turn your head.

In addition, he has to properly adjust the mirrors used in the car.During car driving the drivers wear seat belt for safety. What is the reason? The reason behind this is inertia. If he doesn\u2019t use seat belt, he would lean forward due to inertia of motion for applying fast brake. For this reason he would hit the steering and other bodies in front of him, for this a serious accident may happen. Not only have the drivers, the passengers also had to wear the seat belt if there is an arrangement of seat belt in the car."

        "question": "Why are hilly roads considered risky for driving?",
        "answer": "The reason hilly roads are considered risky for driving is because they have many ups and downs (zigzag pattern) that can cause loss of control while taking turns. The zigzag pattern can also make it difficult to judge distances, leading to accidents. Additionally, when taking sharp turns, drivers may not be able to see oncoming traffic, which increases the risk of an accident. Furthermore, driving in hilly roads at night is particularly hazardous due to reduced visibility.",

If the road is too smooth, it is not possible to stop the car within a certain distance in spite of applying brake. The friction is important for the motion of a car. If the road is too smooth, the necessary reaction force is not produced. The amount of the frictional force is largely reduced when the road is too smooth, as a result the car will not be able to move forward. So, the smoothness of the road will be such that it can supply the necessary frictionalThe smoothness of road has a great impact on the motion of a body. When the road is smooth, movement of vehicles on the road becomes easier and the journey becomes comfortable. As the road becomes smoother, the resistive force of friction becomes lesser.

This means that normal eye can see any object at a distance between 25 cm to infinity. An eye which is unable to see any object distinctly within this distance that eye is a defective eye. Usually an eye has two kinds of defects. These are:\n\n156\n\nPhysics\n\n1. Short sight or Myopia\n\n2. Long sight or HypermetropiaThere are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object.1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.9.9 Human eye\n\nThe structure and functions of human eyes are similar to a camera. We know that photograph is taken by keeping the object before a camera. Similarly if any object is placed before the eyes, there is a picture of that image inside the eyes. The structure and functions of eyes are discussed below."

        "question": "Why does the sandy surface of a desert appear to be wet?",
        "answer": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium (like air) into another with a different speed. When sunlight hits the hot, dry sand in the desert, it bends towards the normal (a line perpendicular to the surface). This bent light then hits the cooler air above the sand and bends again, appearing to come from below the surface, creating an inverted image of a distant object (like a tree) that looks like water.\n\nThe reason for this apparent wetness is total internal reflection. Since the air near the surface has a lower refractive index than the light passing through it, some of the light is reflected back into the sand instead of passing into the cooler air.

        "question": "How are optical fibers used in telecommunications?",
        "answer": "In telecommunications, optical fibers transmit multiple telephone signals at a time with minimal change in signal intensity. The refractive index of the fiber material (1.7) is higher than the surrounding materials (1.5), allowing total internal reflection to occur when light enters at a small angle. This enables the efficient transmission of data through the fiber, facilitating long-distance communication networks and high-speed internet connectivity.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Optical fibers are used to transmit electrical signals over long distances by converting them into optical signals. This allows for the transmission of a large number of signals simultaneously with minimal loss of intensity.",
        "referenceContext": "A set of optical fiber is called optical tube.\nUses of optical fiber in the field of health and telecommunication:\nAn optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner wall of the stomach of any patient.

In a concave lens, the light rays are further diverged as they pass through.\n4. **Image formation**: Due to this divergence, virtual images are formed at a distance behind the lens (in front of the focal point F).\n5. **Size and orientation of the image**: The size and orientation of the image depend on the position of the object relative to the focal length of the lens.\n\nMathematically, the magnification equation is used:\n\nm = l\u2032/l\n\nwhere m is the magnification (ratio of image height to object height), l' is the image distance from the lens, and l is the object distance from the lens.",

When an object is placed at infinity, the eye lens becomes flat and the focal length is zero.\n\nAs the ciliary muscles contract, the lens becomes thinner and its radius of curvature increases, which decreases the focal length. This allows the eye to focus on nearby objects. As the ciliary muscles relax, the lens returns to its normal shape, increasing the focal length and allowing us to see distant objects clearly.\n\nThis process is known as accommodation, and it enables the eye to focus on both near and far objects.",

But for a myopic eye,\ndo = f\nand we know that di < 0 (since it's virtual).\nSubstituting these values in the magnification equation gives us:\nm = -(f)/\u221e or f\n\nSo, the object distance for a myopic eye is finite.\n\nNow, consider a light ray passing through the focal point of the lens. This light ray will bend and appear to be coming from infinity. So, the farthest point at which the image can be seen clearly by a normal eye, but not by a myopic eye, is at 'f' distance.",

Among them the cones cells are colour sensitive. There are three types of cone cells \u2013 blue colour sensitive,Where the image is formed is known as retina. It consists of some light sensitive cells or nerve-fibers called rods and cones. When image or light falls on retina a kind of stimulation is created in the nerve-fibers and as a result a sensation of vision is created in the brain and we can see the object.8. Retina: Just behind the eye lens, there is a layer of semi-transparent light sensitive membrane in the innermost side of the eye ball. It is called the retina. It is made of some nerve-fibers called rods and cones. These nerve-fibers are connected to the eye-nerves. When light falls on the retina, it creates a kind of excitement in nerve- fibers. Hence, a sensation of vision is created in the brain."

        "question": "What is the role of refraction in vision?",
        "answer": "Refraction plays a crucial role in vision by bending light as it passes from one medium to another, allowing us to see objects clearly.\n\nMathematically, the bending of light can be described using Snell's Law:\n\nn1 sin(\u03b81) = n2 sin(\u03b82)\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the refractive indices of the two media, \u03b81 and \u03b82 are the angles of incidence and refraction respectively.\n\nIn the case of vision, light from an object passes through the cornea and lens of the eye, which bends the light using refraction. The image formed on the retina is inverted and real, allowing us to see the object clearly.\n\nWhen light enters a denser medium (like glass) from a rarer medium (like air), it bends towards the normal (i.e., n1 sin(\u03b81) > n2 sin(\u03b82)). Conversely, when light exits a denser medium into a rarer medium, it bends away from the normal. This bending of light by refraction allows us to see objects at different distances and orientations.\n\nIn summary, refraction enables vision by changing the direction of light as it passes through different media, creating an image on the retina that we can see.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refraction of light is essential for vision. The eye lens, a convex lens, refracts incoming light rays to focus them onto the retina, forming a real and inverted image of the object. This image is then processed by the brain to create the sensation of vision.",
        "referenceContext": "It does not matter whether the colour is compound or complex, the eye perceives the colour of an object in terms of these three colours. The cone cells of retina send the accumulated information to brain. Brain separates all these colours through a particular process. Thus we can perceive the colour of coloured object.\n9.13 Uses of refraction in our daily life:\nThere is a convex lens in our eyes. When we seen an object, the light from the object, being refracted by the lens of the eye, forms an image on retina. We can see the object when a real and inverted image of that object is formed on retina. So, refraction of light helps us to see an object.\nThere are many people who have defects in their eyes. Among them some cannot see the distant object, some cannot see near object. For the remedy of the defects we use spectacles made by lens of particular power. The incoming light refracted through the lens falls on our eyes and helps to see the object properly. Therefore, refraction plays an important role to see an object.\nBy using the property of refraction of light we can take photograph with camera, we can see very small object magnifying it by microscope and see the distant object by telescope.\nThe optical fiber that we use in the field of health and telecommunication is also the contribution of refraction of light.\nThere are fish aquariums in many of our houses",

This variation in least distance of distinct vision depends on several factors such as the shape and size of the eyeball.\n\nFor a normal eye, the farthest point of clear vision is infinity. However, this can be calculated using the lens equation:\n\n1/f = 1/do + 1/di\n\nWhere:\nf = focal length of the eye\ndo = distance from object to the eye (near point)\ndi = distance from image to the eye (far point)\n\nSince the far point is at infinity, di can be considered as infinity.

        "question": "Why is electricity transmitted at high voltage?",
        "answer": "Electricity is transmitted at high voltage because it decreases the i2R loss (loss due to resistance) in the power grid. When you increase the transmission line voltage, the value of the electric current becomes lower, resulting in a significant decrease in i2R loss.\n\nThink of it like this: when electricity flows through a conductor, some of its energy is converted to heat due to the resistance in the wire. By increasing the voltage and decreasing the current, we reduce the amount of energy lost as heat.\n\nFor example, if you increase the transmission line voltage by ten times, the electric current becomes one-tenth, which reduces the i2R loss by a factor of 100 (10 x 1/10 = 1). This makes long-distance transmission more efficient and allows for longer lines without significant energy losses.",

During storm and rain it is rather good to wet in rain than to stand under an umbrella, any tree, near any conductor, iron bridge or fence of sharp iron wire.\n\nInvestigation:10.112.2\n\nThis equation suggests that the rate at which a transformer reduces the voltage is exactly equal to the rate at which it increase the current so that the total power remains constant.

        "question": "What happens to the electric current when electricity is transmitted at high voltage?",
        "answer": "When electricity is transmitted at high voltage, the electric current becomes lower. To understand why, let's use Ohm's Law: I = V/R, where I is the current, V is the voltage, and R is the resistance.\n\nIf you increase the voltage (V) while keeping the resistance (R) constant, the current (I) will decrease according to the equation above. This is because the same amount of energy is being transmitted through a longer path, so less energy per unit time is flowing. As an example, if the transmission line voltage is increased by ten times, then the electric current becomes one tenth.\n\nIn terms of loss, this means that I2R (I squared times resistance) loss decreases to a great extent because higher voltage reduces the amount of current flowing through the conductors, resulting in less heat generated and thus lower system loss.",

Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, theThe galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates."

This causes the needle on the compass to deflect from its original position. The direction of deflection depends on the orientation of the current's flow and the magnetic field created by the magnet. \n\nMathematically, this can be represented as: B = \u03bc\u2080nI, where B is the magnetic field strength, \u03bc\u2080 is a constant, n is the number of turns in the coil, and I is the current flowing through it.\n\nIn terms of torque, when a current-carrying wire is placed between the poles of a magnet, a torque (rotational force) acts on the wire due to the interaction with the magnetic field. The direction of this torque depends on the right-hand rule: if you point your thumb in the direction of the current and your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, your palm will face the direction of the torque.\n\nIn simple words, when a current-carrying wire is placed between the poles of a magnet, it deflects due to the interaction between its own magnetic field and the external magnetic field.",

This is due to the Lorentz force equation:\n\nF = q(E + v x B)\n\nwhere:\n- F is the force on the charge\n- q is the charge of the electron\n- E is the electric field strength (not present in this case)\n- v is the velocity of the electron\n- B is the magnetic field strength\n\nSince there is no electric field mentioned, we can ignore it. The force is caused by the magnetic field (B) and the motion of the electrons (v). When the electrons move through the wire, they create a magnetic field that interacts with the external magnetic field of the magnet. This interaction results in a net force on the wire, causing it to deflect or move.\n\nThink of it like this: the moving electrons are \"pushing\" against the magnetic field, which is pushing back.

To remove this difficulty, he entered a plate by sealing it with the filament. He saw that when a positive potential is given to the plate with respect to the filament, an electric current flows through the vacuum tube. But when a negative potential is applied to the plate electric current does not flow. Addison explains this phenomenon in this way- as the emitted charge from the hot filament goes to the positiveAs there is intensity of an electric field, it also has electric potential. Potential determines the direction of motion of a charge in an electric field and also determines the direction in which the charge will flow when two charged conductors are connected by a conductor wire. If the charge creating field is positive, some work is done against the force of repulsion if another positive charge is brought near it. Therefore, the more positive charge is brought from a point at infinity nearer toThe galvanometer\u2019s deflection shows that an electric current is produced. How this electric current is produced? The current is caused by the flow of electrons from the negatively charged plate B through the galvanometer and then to positively charged plate A. The positive charges of plate A are neutralized by the incoming negatively charged electrons. As a result, the transient current which is detected by the galvanometer is produced due to the discharge of the two metal plates."

This added expense is reflected in the final cost of the device.",

        "referenceContext": "Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system",
        "context": " Advantages and disadvantages of analogue and digital signal\n\nWhich one is better between analogue and digital signal can be measured by three factors. These are: the qualitative standard of the signal, the elements to maintain the process and cost or expense.\n\n214\n\nPhysicsstandard of the last signal remains unchanged. Besides many signal can be sent in every second. Though the digital device is more expensive than the analogue device, the total cost is less in digital system than that of the analogue system. Cross connection may be occurred in analogue device but it cannot be happened in digital system.Analogue signal: The magnitude of some quantity which changes continuously is called analogue. The magnitude of the quantities such as sound, light, temperature, pressure can be of any value within a definite extent. Analogue data is sent continuously. Telephone, radio, television broadcast and cable television generally send analogue data. So the analogue signals are continuously changeable voltage or current. This voltage or current is normally changed and can receive any value between thelowest and the highest value. Analogue signal is really a sine wave. Audio and video voltages are the example of analogue signals."

This electric current can move very easily through some substance. There are some mediums through which electricity cannot move at all. Solid materials are classified into three groups depending on their electricity conduction. For example: (1) conductor (2) insulator (3) semiconductor.3. Semiconductor: The materials whose current conduction capacity lies between that of conductors and insulators in normal temperature are called semiconductors.

        "question": "What is the principle behind creating colors on a color television screen?",
        "answer": "The principle behind creating colors on a color TV screen is based on the concept of additive color mixing. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The camera has three separate electron guns, one for each primary color: Red (R), Blue (B), and Green (G). These guns emit electrons that excite the phosphor granules in the screen.\n2. When an electron gun emits electrons, it creates a specific wavelength of light:\n\t* Red light has a wavelength around 620-750 nanometers\n\t* Blue light has a wavelength around 450-495 nanometers\n\t* Green light has a wavelength around 520-560 nanometers\n3. The phosphor granules in the screen are coated with different materials that emit light at these specific wavelengths when excited by the electron beams.\n4. When all three electron guns fire simultaneously, they create a combination of red, blue, and green light on the screen.\n5. By adjusting the intensity of each electron gun, the resulting color can be created:\n\t* More red and blue light creates a shade of purple\n\t* More blue and green light creates a shade of cyan\n\t* More red and green light creates a shade of yellow\n\t* More of all three colors creates white\n6. By mixing different intensities of these primary colors, the TV can display a wide range of colors on the screen.\n\nThis additive color mixing principle is the same reason why RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color models are used in digital displays like monitors and televisions.",

        "answer": "The function of the mouthpiece (microphone) in a telephone is to convert your voice into an electrical signal. This process is called transduction. When you speak, your voice creates pressure changes in the air molecules around the microphone. The microphone converts these pressure changes into electrical signals that are sent through the telephone wire or radio wave to the other end of the call.\n\nMathematically, this can be represented by the equation for simple harmonic motion (SHM):\n\nv(t) = A sin(2\u03c0ft)\n\nwhere v(t) is the voltage at time t, A is the amplitude, f is the frequency, and t is time. The microphone essentially acts as a device that converts this SHM into an electrical signal.\n\nIn essence, the mouthpiece's primary function is to convert sound waves (your voice) into electrical signals that can be transmitted over wires or radio waves for communication.",

        "question": "What is the relationship between physics and biology?",
        "answer": "1. No, physical world and biological world do not follow totally different rules. They both follow laws of physics, although some complex systems like living organisms may require additional assumptions or approximations.\n\n2. Bio-physics originated when scientists realized that physics can be used to understand and describe the behavior of living systems. The foundation of bio-physics was laid by several researchers including Claude Shannon's work on information theory which helped in understanding biological processes in terms of energy and thermodynamics.\n\n3. Laws of physics can be applied to the living world because they are universal and apply everywhere. However, the laws need to be adapted and simplified for living systems, taking into account additional factors such as entropy, homeostasis, evolution, etc.\n\n4. Jagdish Chandra Bose made significant contributions in plant physiology by demonstrating that plants respond to physical stimuli like light, sound, touch, etc. He is often considered a pioneer of bio-physics.\n\n5. I don't know about his contributions in biophysics.\n\n6. Human body behaves as a machine when it operates within certain limits and can be explained using physical laws. For example, the heart beats at 72-100 times per minute due to the contraction and relaxation of cardiac muscles, which follow Hooke's Law for elastic materials. Additionally, the nervous system transmits signals through electrical impulses that obey Ohm's law.\n\n7. Here are some arguments in favor of human body being an organic machine:\n   a. Both machines and living systems use energy to function.\n   b. Machines have mechanical parts that interact with each other according to physical laws.\n   c. Living systems exhibit thermodynamic properties like efficiency, entropy, and heat transfer.\n   d. Biological processes can be described using mathematical models similar to those used in physics.\n   e. The human body's response to physical stimuli follows the same principles as machines do.\n\nRelationship between Physics and Biology: \nPhysics is a fundamental science that studies the laws governing the universe, while biology is the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. However, both subjects overlap significantly, especially when dealing with complex systems like living organisms. Physics provides the underlying principles for understanding biological processes, such as thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and mechanics.

It's like finding a pattern in nature that relates seemingly unrelated concepts, such as how cells divide or how neurons communicate.\n\nMathematically, this can be described using the concept of **determinism**, which states that every event has a cause-and-effect relationship with its surroundings. In biology, we observe complex systems with many variables interacting with each other, but biophysics aims to identify underlying laws that govern these interactions.\n\nFor example, in **population dynamics**, biologists study how populations grow or decline over time. Biophysics can help explain this using mathematical equations like the **logistic growth model**:\n\ndN/dt = rN(1 - N/K)\n\nwhere N is the population size, r is the growth rate, and K is the carrying capacity.\n\nBy applying physical laws to biological systems, biophysics provides a more comprehensive understanding of life's underlying mechanisms, enabling us to make predictions about complex phenomena like disease progression or behavior in ecosystems.",

        "question": "How does the human body obtain energy?",
        "answer": "The human body obtains energy from food ingestion and respiration. Food provides the body with chemical energy, which is released through a series of chemical reactions in the body.\n\nEnergy is defined as the ability to do work. The more energy a body has, the more work it can perform.\n\nIn simple terms, when you eat food, your body breaks down the nutrients into molecules like glucose. This process releases stored energy that can be used by your cells.\n\nThe main sources of chemical energy for the human body are:\n\n1. Carbohydrates (from food)\n2. Fat (from fat-rich foods)\n\nWhen carbohydrates or fats are broken down in the body, they release a type of energy called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This energy is then used to power various bodily functions.\n\nRespiration also plays an important role in energy production. Oxygen helps break down glucose in cells, releasing more ATP and providing energy for cellular processes.\n\nSo, to summarize: food provides the body with chemical energy, which is released through respiration and used by cells to perform various functions.",

So the body which is able to work has energy in it and the body that does not have energy in it cannot work.\n\nPhysics\n\n71\n\nWhen we say a body has energy in it we mean the body can apply force on other and can work. Again the amount of work done on a body is equal to the energy we use.The most common form of energy is mechanical energy. The energy that is stored in a body due to its position or motion is called mechanical energy. In this lesson we will discuss two forms of mechanical energy-kinetic energy is produced due to motion and potential energy is produced due to the position of object.Food and fuel, such as oil, gas, coal and wood are the sources of chemical energy. The energy of food is released in our body by chemical reaction and we can work when this energy is transformed into other forms of energy. When fuel is burnt in an engine or boiler, transformation of energy takes place. In an electric cell chemical energy is transformed into electrical energy. In the filament of an electric bulb, electrical energy is transformed into light and heat energy."

X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result,X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation.

Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray isvery high speed and hit the target anode. Due to this, the motion of electrons suddenly stops and X-ray is produced. Here, the kinetic energy of electrons transforms into electromagnetic wave. This radiation of small wavelength is the X-ray.

        "context": " X-ray is a kind of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of X-ray is much lesser than that of the ordinary light. Its wavelength is about 10-10 m. X-ray was invented by Wilhelm Roentgen in 1895. Another name of Roentgen ray is X-ray. When the nature of Roentgen ray was not known, for being an unknown ray it was named X-ray. The power of X-ray to penetrate any material becomes more as its wavelength gets smaller. Ordinary light is visible and divided into different colours, but X-ray isinvisible. If an opaque medium is placed in the path of ordinary light, it cannot penetrate the medium. On the other hand X-ray has high penetrating power. X-ray is produced in an X-ray tube. X-ray tube is a vacuum glass tube. There are two electrodes placed at the two ends of the glass tube. One of them is called cathode and the other is anode. There is a coil made of tungsten in cathode which is called filament. The cathode is heated by the current flowing through the filament. As a result,very high speed and hit the target anode. Due to this, the motion of electrons suddenly stops and X-ray is produced. Here, the kinetic energy of electrons transforms into electromagnetic wave. This radiation of small wavelength is the X-ray.

        "question": "How does an ECG work?",
        "answer": "An ECG measures the electrical impulses that trigger a heartbeat by detecting the tiny changes in voltage that occur when these impulses pass through the heart muscle. Here's how it works:\n\n1. A small current (milliamperes) is passed between two electrodes placed on the skin.\n2. This current creates an electric field around the heart, which affects the electrical signals produced by the heartbeat.\n3. The changes in this electric field are detected by a series of sensors called electrodes.\n4. These sensors convert these changes into electrical signals, which are sent to a machine that records them as a waveform.\n\nThink of it like taking a picture with your phone. The sensor is like the camera's sensor, and it captures the image (electrical signal) and sends it to the machine for display (the ECG tracing).\n\nMathematically, this can be represented by Ohm's Law:\n\nI = V/R\n\nWhere:\n- I is the current\n- V is the voltage (change in electric field)\n- R is the resistance of the skin\n\nBut for an actual ECG, you don't need to know Ohm's Law.

This is due to the angle at which light hits the inner surface of the tube, causing it to bend back into the tube instead of passing outwards.\n\n Mathematically: Snell's law (sin\u03b81 / sin\u03b82) = n1 / n2 \n\nwhere \u03b81 and \u03b82 are angles and n1 and n2 are refractive indices of two media. In the case of optical fiber, light travels from air into a denser medium like the tissue in the stomach, so \u03b81 < \u03b82. Therefore, sin\u03b81 \u2248 0, resulting in sin\u03b82 \u2248 1 or \u03b82 = 90\u00b0, which is total internal reflection.",
        "referenceAnswer": "Through total internal reflection on the inner walls of the optical fibers.",
        "referenceContext": "In an endoscope machine, there are two tubes. Through one of them light is transferred to a definite organ of patient's body from outside. Due to the total internal reflection of light on the inner wall of the optical fiber, bright light enters the body cavity of patient.",
        "context": " An optical tube is passed through the mouth to stomach in order to examine the inner wall of the stomach of any patient. A set of optical fiber of this optical tube is sent to lighten the stomach and the other set helps to see the lightened portion of stomach from the outside. This process is known as endoscopy. In this way by sending optical tube the block inside the artery, vein and function of valves of heart can be observed. Optical fiber is used for sending or receiving electrical signalsFigure: 14.7 Endoscopy\n\nIn an endoscope machine, there are two tubes. Through one of them light is transferred to a definite organ of patient\u2019s body from outside. Due to the total internal reflection of light on the inner wall of the optical fiber, bright light enters the body cavity of patient.\n\n235\n\n236\n\nPhysicsThis light illuminates the diseased or injured organ. The reflected part of light returns back through the second fiber optic tube in the same way. The reflected light enters the eyes of doctors through the eyepiece lens. As a result, the doctor can see what is happening inside the examined organ.The beam is reflected, absorbed or transmitted by the organ toward which they are directed, depending on the nature of the surface they strike.\n\nAs the beam strikes an interface or boundary between tissues of varying density (e.g., muscle and blood) part of the sound waves are reflected back to the transducer as echoes. The echoes are then converted into electrical impulses that are displayed on a monitor presenting a \u2018picture\u2019 of the organ or muscle under examination."
