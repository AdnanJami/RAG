An electroscope is a device that consists of a metal rod with a lightweight, conductive leaf attached to it. When a charged object is brought near the rod, the charges on the object induce a separation of charges on the rod and leaf. This causes the leaf to deflect away from the rod, indicating the presence of a charge. The direction of the deflection indicates the nature of the charge. If the leaf deflects in the same direction as the charge on the object, the charge on the object is the same as the charge on the leaf.

In a diagram of lines of force of an electric field, the gap between the lines indicates the magnitude of intensity of electric field. In an electric field where the lines of forces are closer magnitude of E is greater there and where the lines of forces are away magnitude of E is less there.\nFor different positions of charged object, the nature of the lines of force of an electric field varies. Lines of force of a few electric are described below. For the simplicity of description the conductors are taken as spherical.\n1. For an isolated positive charge the nature of lines of force is shown in figure 10.11(a). In this case the lines of force emerged uniformly from the surface of the conductor perpendicularly.

        "referenceContext": "When a positively charged body is grounded electrons coming from the earth neutralize the body. When a negatively charged body is grounded\n\n\nelectrons from the body flow to the earth and the body becomes neutral. The earth is so big that if charge is added or taken away from it its potential does not change at all. Likewise if water is taken away from sea or poured in the water level does not change. The earth is always taking charge from different bodies and simultaneously it supplies charge to other bodies. Hence earth is considered charge less. To determine the height of a place the height of the sea level is taken as zero, similarly to determine the potential of a body, the potential of earth is taken as zero.\nZero, Positive and Negative Potential:\nThe potential of an uncharged conductor is taken as zero. When a charged conductor is connected to the earth its potential becomes zero. Because, in the connected state , both the conductor and the earth is considered as a single conductor. The potential of a positively charged body is positive and negatively charged body is negative.\nUnit of potential, Volt:\nIf the work done in bringing 1 coulomb (1C) of positive charge from infinity to a point in the electric field is 1 joule (1J), then the potential at that point is called 1 volt (1V).\nThe potential at a point in an electric field is 20V means to bring 1 coulomb (1C) positive charge from infinity to that point 20J work is to be done.\nPotential difference:\nLet, in an electric field A and B are two points and the potentials of the points are VA and VB respectively (fig: 10.14)"

        "referenceAnswer": "Thunder is caused by the rapid expansion and contraction of air during a lightning strike.  The electrical discharge heats the air around the lightning bolt, causing it to expand rapidly.

        "referenceAnswer": "A lightning conductor works by attracting a lightning strike and safely conducting the electrical charge to the ground.  It consists of a metal rod with several sharp points at the top, which is fixed to the highest point of the building. The rod is connected to a wire that runs down the building and is buried into the ground. When a charged cloud passes above the building, the rod induces an opposite charge, causing the charge to accumulate at the sharp points. The sharp points discharge the charge to the surrounding air particles, neutralizing the cloud's charge. This reduces the likelihood of a lightning strike on the building, directing the strike to the conductor instead. The charge is then safely conducted to the ground through the wire.",

        "referenceAnswer": "During a storm, it is safer to be wet in the rain than to stand under an umbrella, a tree, or near a conductor because these objects can attract lightning strikes. Lightning tends to follow the path of least resistance to the ground, and tall, pointed objects provide a good pathway for the electrical charge to flow. When you are wet, the water on your body acts as a conductor, allowing any charge to flow safely to the ground. However, an umbrella, a tree, or a conductor could attract the lightning strike, potentially causing harm to anyone standing near them.",
