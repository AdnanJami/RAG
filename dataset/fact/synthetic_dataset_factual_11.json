        "referenceAnswer": "3.6 \u00d7 10^6 J",
        "referenceContext": "Therefore, the amount of electrical energy converted or spent when an electric device of 1 kilowatt power works for 1 hour is called 1 kilowatt-hour or 1 unit.\\n1 kWh = 3.6\u00d7 106 J"

        "question": "What is the main cause of system loss in an electrical circuit?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Resistance in the wires",
        "referenceContext": "The current passing through the wire produces heat due to resistance. This heat energy is called system loss. The greater the current, the more the heat produced."

    {
        "question": "What is the main reason for system loss in electricity transmission?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Resistance in the conducting wires",
        "referenceContext": "The conducting wires which are used for electricity transmission have a definite amount of resistance. As a result, to overcome this resistance, part of the electrical energy is converted to heat."

        "question": "Why is electricity transmitted at high voltage?",
        "referenceAnswer": "To decrease the loss of energy due to the power grid or conductor",
        "referenceContext": "Due to the transmission of electricity at high voltage, the loss that occurs due to the power grid or of conductor is decreased to a great extent."

        "question": "What happens to the electric current when electricity is transmitted at high voltage?",
        "referenceAnswer": "The value of the electric current becomes lower",
        "referenceContext": "For a definite amount of electrical energy, the value of the electric current becomes lower due to high voltage transmission"
