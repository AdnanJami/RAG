        "referenceContext": "Suppose two friends- Roni and Oni live on the fifth floor of a building. The mass of the two friends is the same. Coming to the lift at the ground floor they found the lift not working. They had to use the stairs to go up the building. Roni took 40 seconds and Oni took 80 seconds to reach the 5th floor. We say Roni has more power than Oni. Though both of them has done same amount of work to reach the same height Roni has more power because he has done the work faster. Power is the rate of doing work or transformation of energy. Power of a person or a source is measured by the amount of work done per unit time.\nPower = Work\nIf as person or a device can do W amount of work or transform energy at time t then the power P will be,\n\nP = \tW\t\nPower has no direction.
