Atmosphere is always exerting pressure on the mercury of the container. This pressure is convoyed through the mercury and acts in the upward direction in the tube. This very pressure holds the mercury column\n\nTorricelli's vacuum\n\n\n\n\n cm\n\n\n\nFigur: 5.3\n\nof the tube. In absence of this pressure the mercury of the tube will come down due to the force of gravity. Therefore, atmospheric pressure is equal to the pressure of the mercury column of the tube. Generally the height of the mercury column that remains in the tube in about 76cm i.e. the air pressure supports the pressure of 76cm column of mercury. In this way using the height of a liquid the atmospheric pressure can be measured.\nThe space that remains just above the mercury column in the tube up to its closed end is totally empty. This empty space is termed as Torricelli's vacuum. Only a scarce amount of mercury vapor exists there"
