        "question": "What is refraction of light?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Refraction of light is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another. This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds in different mediums. For example, light travels slower in water than it does in air. When light passes from a faster medium to a slower medium, it bends towards the normal. When light passes from a slower medium to a faster medium, it bends away from the normal.",

        "question": "What is total internal reflection?",
        "referenceAnswer": "Total internal reflection is a phenomenon that occurs when light traveling in a denser medium (such as water) is incident on a boundary with a less dense medium (such as air) at an angle greater than the critical angle. In this case, the light is reflected back into the denser medium, rather than being transmitted into the less dense medium.",

The power of a lens is expressed in diopters (D), where 1 diopter is equal to 1/1 meter. A converging lens (convex lens) has a positive power, while a diverging lens (concave lens) has a negative power.

However, sometimes the eye's ability to focus is impaired, leading to eye defects. The most common eye defects are myopia (nearsightedness), hypermetropia (farsightedness), and presbyopia (age-related farsightedness). Myopia occurs when the eye is too long, causing distant objects to appear blurry. Hypermetropia occurs when the eye is too short, causing near objects to appear blurry.

Long sight or Hypermetropia\n1. Short sight or Myopia: If anybody has this problem, he or she cannot see any distant object distinctly but can see anything of near distance distinctly. Sometimes the distance of near point for such an eye is less than 25 cm. Therefore, if the near point of the eye is less than 25cm then that is also considered as short sight.\nCause: This defect may be caused if the radius of the eye ball increases or if the focal length decreases for any reason and thereby increases the power of convergence of the eye lens. [Figure 9.22 (a) ]\nEffects of such problem: In this case, rays of light coming from any object placed at large distance, after refraction through the eye lens converge to a point I in front of the retina (Fig"

For this reason, such type of eye cannot see object distinctly placed beyond F (Fig 9.22(b) ]\nRemedy: It has been said earlier that such type of defect arises due to the increase in the power of convergence of the eye lens. To remedy this defect, we need to decrease the power of convergence of the eye lens. For doing this, concave lens is used as aid lens or as spectacles.\nBesides, only a concave lens can create a virtual, erect and diminished image at a position nearer than that of the object.
